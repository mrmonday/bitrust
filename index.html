    librustc: Make `Copy` opt-in.
    
    This change makes the compiler no longer infer whether types (structures
    and enumerations) implement the `Copy` trait (and thus are implicitly
    copyable). Rather, you must implement `Copy` yourself via `impl Copy for
    MyType {}`.
    
    A new warning has been added, `missing_copy_implementations`, to warn
    you if a non-generic public type has been added that could have
    implemented `Copy` but didn't.
    
    For convenience, you may *temporarily* opt out of this behavior by using
    `#![feature(opt_out_copy)]`. Note though that this feature gate will never be
    accepted and will be removed by the time that 1.0 is released, so you should
    transition your code away from using it.
    
    This breaks code like:
    
        #[deriving(Show)]
        struct Point2D {
            x: int,
            y: int,
        }
    
        fn main() {
            let mypoint = Point2D {
                x: 1,
                y: 1,
            };
            let otherpoint = mypoint;
            println!("{}{}", mypoint, otherpoint);
        }
    
    Change this code to:
    
        #[deriving(Show)]
        struct Point2D {
            x: int,
            y: int,
        }
    
        impl Copy for Point2D {}
    
        fn main() {
            let mypoint = Point2D {
                x: 1,
                y: 1,
            };
            let otherpoint = mypoint;
            println!("{}{}", mypoint, otherpoint);
        }
    
    This is the backwards-incompatible part of #13231.
    
    Part of RFC #3.

    libserialize: Always use a decimal point when emitting a float value
    
    JSON doesn't distinguish between integer and float. They are just
    numbers. Also, in the current implementation, a fractional number
    without the fractional part is encoded without a decimal point.
    
    Thereforce, when the value is decoded, it is first rendered as Json,
    either I64 or U64. This reduces type safety, because while the original
    intention was to cast the value to float, it can also be casted to
    integer.
    
    As a workaround of this problem, this commit makes the encoder always
    emit a decimal point even if it is not necessary. If the fractional part
    of a float number is zero, ".0" is padded to the end of the result.

    libserialize: Do not coerce to integer when decoding a float value
    
    When an integral value is expected by the user but a fractional value is
    found, the current implementation uses std::num::cast() to coerce to an
    integer type, losing the fractional part. This behavior is not desirable
    because the number loses precision without notice.
    
    This commit makes it raise ExpectedError when such a situation arises.

    libserialize: Remove float preprocessing in serialize::json::Encoder
    
    serialize::json::Encoder currently uses f64 to emit any integral type.
    This is possibly due to the behavior of JavaScript, which uses f64 to
    represent any numeric value.
    
    This leads to a problem that only the integers in the range of [-2^53+1,
    2^53-1] can be encoded. Therefore, i64 and u64 cannot be used reliably
    in the current implementation.
    
    RFC 7159 suggests that good interoperability can be achieved if the
    range is respected by implementations. However, it also says that
    implementations are allowed to set the range of number accepted. And it
    seems that the JSON encoders outside of the JavaScript world usually
    make use of i64 values.
    
    This commit removes the float preprocessing done in the emit_* methods.
    It also increases performance, because transforming f64 into String
    costs more than that of an integral type.
    
    Fixes #18319

    rollup merge of #19416: sfackler/global-stdin
    
    io::stdin returns a new `BufferedReader` each time it's called, which
    results in some very confusing behavior with disappearing output. It now
    returns a `StdinReader`, which wraps a global singleton
    `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;BufferedReader&lt;StdReader&gt;&gt;`. `Reader` is implemented directly
    on `StdinReader`. However, `Buffer` is not, as the `fill_buf` method is
    fundamentaly un-thread safe. A `lock` method is defined on `StdinReader`
    which returns a smart pointer wrapping the underlying `BufferedReader`
    while guaranteeing mutual exclusion.
    
    Code that treats the return value of io::stdin as implementing `Buffer`
    will break. Add a call to `lock`:
    
    ```rust
    io::stdin().read_line();
    // =&gt;
    io::stdin().lock().read_line();
    ```

    rollup merge of #19274: alexcrichton/rewrite-sync
    
    This commit is a reimplementation of `std::sync` to be based on the
    system-provided primitives wherever possible. The previous implementation was
    fundamentally built on top of channels, and as part of the runtime reform it has
    become clear that this is not the level of abstraction that the standard level
    should be providing. This rewrite aims to provide as thin of a shim as possible
    on top of the system primitives in order to make them safe.
    
    The overall interface of the `std::sync` module has in general not changed, but
    there are a few important distinctions, highlighted below:
    
    * The condition variable type, `Condvar`, has been separated out of a `Mutex`.
      A condition variable is now an entirely separate type. This separation
      benefits users who only use one mutex, and provides a clearer distinction of
      who's responsible for managing condition variables (the application).
    
    * All of `Condvar`, `Mutex`, and `RWLock` are now directly built on top of
      system primitives rather than using a custom implementation. The `Once`,
      `Barrier`, and `Semaphore` types are still built upon these abstractions of
      the system primitives.
    
    * The `Condvar`, `Mutex`, and `RWLock` types all have a new static type and
      constant initializer corresponding to them. These are provided primarily for C
      FFI interoperation, but are often useful to otherwise simply have a global
      lock. The types, however, will leak memory unless `destroy()` is called on
      them, which is clearly documented.
    
    * The fundamental architecture of this design is to provide two separate layers.
      The first layer is that exposed by `sys_common` which is a cross-platform
      bare-metal abstraction of the system synchronization primitives. No attempt is
      made at making this layer safe, and it is quite unsafe to use! It is currently
      not exported as part of the API of the standard library, but the stabilization
      of the `sys` module will ensure that these will be exposed in time. The
      purpose of this layer is to provide the core cross-platform abstractions if
      necessary to implementors.
    
      The second layer is the layer provided by `std::sync` which is intended to be
      the thinnest possible layer on top of `sys_common` which is entirely safe to
      use. There are a few concerns which need to be addressed when making these
      system primitives safe:
    
        * Once used, the OS primitives can never be **moved**. This means that they
          essentially need to have a stable address. The static primitives use
          `&amp;'static self` to enforce this, and the non-static primitives all use a
          `Box` to provide this guarantee.
    
        * Poisoning is leveraged to ensure that invalid data is not accessible from
          other tasks after one has panicked.
    
      In addition to these overall blanket safety limitations, each primitive has a
      few restrictions of its own:
    
        * Mutexes and rwlocks can only be unlocked from the same thread that they
          were locked by. This is achieved through RAII lock guards which cannot be
          sent across threads.
    
        * Mutexes and rwlocks can only be unlocked if they were previously locked.
          This is achieved by not exposing an unlocking method.
    
        * A condition variable can only be waited on with a locked mutex. This is
          achieved by requiring a `MutexGuard` in the `wait()` method.
    
        * A condition variable cannot be used concurrently with more than one mutex.
          This is guaranteed by dynamically binding a condition variable to
          precisely one mutex for its entire lifecycle. This restriction may be able
          to be relaxed in the future (a mutex is unbound when no threads are
          waiting on the condvar), but for now it is sufficient to guarantee safety.
    
    * Condvars support timeouts for their blocking operations. The
      implementation for these operations is provided by the system.
    
    Due to the modification of the `Condvar` API, removal of the `std::sync::mutex`
    API, and reimplementation, this is a breaking change. Most code should be fairly
    easy to port using the examples in the documentation of these primitives.

    auto merge of #19167 : japaric/rust/rhs-cmp, r=aturon
    
    Comparison traits have gained an `Rhs` input parameter that defaults to `Self`. And now the comparison operators can be overloaded to work between different types. In particular, this PR allows the following operations (and their commutative versions):
    
    - `&amp;str` == `String` == `CowString`
    - `&amp;[A]` == `&amp;mut [B]` == `Vec&lt;C&gt;` == `CowVec&lt;D&gt;` == `[E, ..N]` (for `N` up to 32)
    - `&amp;mut A` == `&amp;B` (for `Sized` `A` and `B`)
    
    Where `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E` may be different types that implement `PartialEq`. For example, these comparisons are now valid: `string == "foo"`, and `vec_of_strings == ["Hello", "world"]`.
    
    [breaking-change]s
    
    Since the `==` may now work on different types, operations that relied on the old "same type restriction" to drive type inference, will need to be type annotated. These are the most common fallout cases:
    
    - `some_vec == some_iter.collect()`: `collect` needs to be type annotated: `collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;()`
    - `slice == &amp;[a, b, c]`: RHS doesn't get coerced to an slice, use an array instead `[a, b, c]`
    - `lhs == []`: Change expression to `lhs.is_empty()`
    - `lhs == some_generic_function()`: Type annotate the RHS as necessary

    This is a [breaking-change]: change types like `&amp;Foo+Send` or `&amp;'a mut Foo+'a` to `&amp;(Foo+Send)` and `&amp;'a mut (Foo+'a)`, respectively.

    At the same time remove the `pub use` of the variants in favor of accessing
    through the enum type itself. This is a breaking change as the `Found` and
    `NotFound` variants must now be imported through `BinarySearchResult` instead of
    just `std::slice`.

    auto merge of #19176 : aturon/rust/stab-iter, r=alexcrichton
    
    This is an initial pass at stabilizing the `iter` module. The module is
    fairly large, but is also pretty polished, so most of the stabilization
    leaves things as they are.
    
    Some changes:
    
    * Due to the new object safety rules, various traits needs to be split
      into object-safe traits and extension traits. This includes `Iterator`
      itself. While splitting up the traits adds some complexity, it will
      also increase flexbility: once we have automatic impls of `Trait` for
      trait objects over `Trait`, then things like the iterator adapters
      will all work with trait objects.
    
    * Iterator adapters that use up the entire iterator now take it by
      value, which makes the semantics more clear and helps catch bugs. Due
      to the splitting of Iterator, this does not affect trait objects. If
      the underlying iterator is still desired for some reason, `by_ref` can
      be used. (Note: this change had no fallout in the Rust distro except
      for the useless mut lint.)
    
    * In general, extension traits new and old are following an [in-progress
      convention](rust-lang/rfcs#445). As such, they
      are marked `unstable`.
    
    * As usual, anything involving closures is `unstable` pending unboxed
      closures.
    
    * A few of the more esoteric/underdeveloped iterator forms (like
      `RandomAccessIterator` and `MutableDoubleEndedIterator`, along with
      various unfolds) are left experimental for now.
    
    * The `order` submodule is left `experimental` because it will hopefully
      be replaced by generalized comparison traits.
    
    * "Leaf" iterators (like `Repeat` and `Counter`) are uniformly
      constructed by free fns at the module level. That's because the types
      are not otherwise of any significance (if we had `impl Trait`, you
      wouldn't want to define a type at all).

    Unpublicize reexports, unprefix JSON type aliases
    
    The type aliases json::JsonString and json::JsonObject were originally
    prefixed with 'json' to prevent collisions with (at the time) the enums
    json::String and json::Object respectively. Now that enum namespacing
    has landed, this 'json' prefix is redundant and can be removed:
    
    json::JsonArray -&gt; json::Array
    json::JsonObject -&gt; json::Object
    
    In addition, this commit also unpublicizes all of the re-exports in this

    Clean up FileType enum following enum namespacing

    This commit removes the `std::local_data` module in favor of a new `std::thread_local`
    module providing thread local storage. The module provides two variants of TLS:
    one which owns its contents and one which is based on scoped references. Each
    implementation has pros and cons listed in the documentation.
    
    Both flavors have accessors through a function called `with` which yield a
    reference to a closure provided. Both flavors also panic if a reference cannot
    be yielded and provide a function to test whether an access would panic or not.
    This is an implementation of [RFC 461][rfc] and full details can be found in
    that RFC.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the removal of the `std::local_data` module.
    All users can migrate to the new tls system like so:
    
        thread_local!(static FOO: Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt; = Rc::new(RefCell::new(None)))
    
    The old `local_data` module inherently contained the `Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;` as

    unicode: Rename UnicodeChar::is_digit to is_numeric
    
    'Numeric' is the proper name of the unicode character class,
    and this frees up the word 'digit' for ascii use in libcore.
    
    Since I'm going to rename `Char::is_digit_radix` to
    `is_digit`, I am not leaving a deprecated method in place,
    because that would just cause name clashes, as both
    `Char` and `UnicodeChar` are in the prelude.

    auto merge of #18967 : aturon/rust/remove-runtime, r=alexcrichton
    
    This PR completes the removal of the runtime system and green-threaded abstractions as part of implementing [RFC 230](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230).
    
    Specifically:
    
    * It removes the `Runtime` trait, welding the scheduling infrastructure directly to native threads.
    
    * It removes `libgreen` and `libnative` entirely.
    
    * It rewrites `sync::mutex` as a trivial layer on top of native mutexes. Eventually, the two modules will be merged.
    
    * It hides the vast majority of `std::rt`.
    
    This completes the basic task of removing the runtime system (I/O and scheduling) and components that depend on it.
    
    After this lands, a follow-up PR will pull the `rustrt` crate back into `std`, turn `std::task` into `std::thread` (with API changes to go along with it), and completely cut out the remaining startup/teardown sequence. Other changes, including new [TLS](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/461) and synchronization are in the RFC or pre-RFC phase.

    Make most of std::rt private
    
    Previously, the entire runtime API surface was publicly exposed, but
    that is neither necessary nor desirable. This commit hides most of the
    module, using librustrt directly as needed. The arrangement will need to
    be revisited when rustrt is pulled into std.

    auto merge of #18638 : aturon/rust/as_slice_dst, r=japaric
    
    This PR changes `AsSlice` to work on unsized types, and changes the
    `impl` for `&amp;[T]` to `[T]`. Aside from making the trait more general,
    this also helps some ongoing work with method resolution changes.
    
    This is a breaking change: code that uses generics bounded by `AsSlice`
    will have to change. In particular, such code previously often took
    arguments of type `V` where `V: AsSlice&lt;T&gt;` by value. These should now
    be taken by reference:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo&lt;Sized? V: AsSlice&lt;T&gt;&gt;(v: &amp;V) { .. }
    ```
    
    A few std lib functions have been changed accordingly.
    
    The PR also relaxes constraints on generics and traits within the
    `core::ops` module and for the `Equiv` trait.

    This commit applies the stabilization of std::fmt as outlined in [RFC 380][rfc].
    There are a number of breaking changes as a part of this commit which will need
    to be handled to migrated old code:
    
    * A number of formatting traits have been removed: String, Bool, Char, Unsigned,
      Signed, and Float. It is recommended to instead use Show wherever possible or
      to use adaptor structs to implement other methods of formatting.
    
    * The format specifier for Boolean has changed from `t` to `b`.
    
    * The enum `FormatError` has been renamed to `Error` as well as becoming a unit
      struct instead of an enum. The `WriteError` variant no longer exists.
    
    * The `format_args_method!` macro has been removed with no replacement. Alter
      code to use the `format_args!` macro instead.
    
    * The public fields of a `Formatter` have become read-only with no replacement.
      Use a new formatting string to alter the formatting flags in combination with
      the `write!` macro. The fields can be accessed through accessor methods on the
      `Formatter` structure.
    
    Other than these breaking changes, the contents of std::fmt should now also all
    contain stability markers. Most of them are still #[unstable] or #[experimental]

    Make os::getcwd() return IoResult&lt;Path&gt;
    
    os::getcwd() panics if the current directory is not available. According
    to getcwd(3), there are three cases:
    
    - EACCES: Permission denied.
    - ENOENT: The current working directory has been removed.
    - ERANGE: The buffer size is less than the actual absolute path.
    
    This commit makes os::getcwd() return IoResult&lt;Path&gt;, not just Path,
    preventing it from panicking.
    
    As os::make_absolute() depends on os::getcwd(), it is also modified to

    change return type of slice_shift_char
    
    `slice_shift_char` splits a `str` into it's leading `char` and the remainder
    of the `str`. Currently, it returns a `(Option&lt;char&gt;, &amp;str)` such that:
    
        "bar".slice_shift_char() =&gt; (Some('b'), "ar")
        "ar".slice_shift_char()  =&gt; (Some('a'), "r")
        "r".slice_shift_char()   =&gt; (Some('r'), "")
        "".slice_shift_char()    =&gt; (None,      "")
    
    This is a little odd. Either a `str` can be split into both a head and a
    tail or it cannot. So the return type should be `Option&lt;(char, &amp;str)&gt;`.
    With the current behaviour, in the case of the empty string, the `str`
    returned is meaningless - it is always the empty string.
    
    This commit changes slice_shift_char so that:
    
        "bar".slice_shift_char() =&gt; Some(('b', "ar"))
        "ar".slice_shift_char()  =&gt; Some(('a', "r"))
        "r".slice_shift_char()   =&gt; Some(('r', ""))
        "".slice_shift_char()    =&gt; None

    This moves chars() and lines() out of Buffer and into separate traits (CharsBuffer and LinesBuffer respectively) - this matches the pattern used for bytes() on Reader (with BytesReader).
    
    (I came across this when I wanted a trait object of a Buffer, so that I could use read_line(); rustc errors about std::io::Buffer not being object-safe.)
    
    [breaking-change]
    Any uses of Buffer::lines() will need to use the new trait std::io::LinesBuffer.
    The same is true for Buffer::chars() with std::io::CharsBuffer.

    Rewrite std::sync::TaskPool to be load balancing and panic-resistant
    
    The previous implementation was very likely to cause panics during
    unwinding through this process:
    
    - child panics, drops its receiver
    - taskpool comes back around and sends another job over to that child
    - the child receiver has hung up, so the taskpool panics on send
    - during unwinding, the taskpool attempts to send a quit message to
      the child, causing a panic during unwinding
    - panic during unwinding causes a process abort
    
    This meant that TaskPool upgraded any child panic to a full process
    abort. This came up in Iron when it caused crashes in long-running
    servers.
    
    This implementation uses a single channel to communicate between
    spawned tasks and the TaskPool, which significantly reduces the complexity
    of the implementation and cuts down on allocation. The TaskPool uses
    the channel as a single-producer-multiple-consumer queue.
    
    Additionally, through the use of send_opt and recv_opt instead of
    send and recv, this TaskPool is robust on the face of child panics,
    both before, during, and after the TaskPool itself is dropped.
    
    Due to the TaskPool no longer using an `init_fn_factory`, this is a
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    otherwise, the API has not changed.
    
    If you used `init_fn_factory` in your code, and this change breaks for
    you, you can instead use an `AtomicUint` counter and a channel to
    move information into child tasks.

    This implements a considerable portion of rust-lang/rfcs#369 (tracked in #18640). Some interpretations had to be made in order to get this to work. The breaking changes are listed below:
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    - `core::num::{Num, Unsigned, Primitive}` have been deprecated and their re-exports removed from the `{std, core}::prelude`.
    - `core::num::{Zero, One, Bounded}` have been deprecated. Use the static methods on `core::num::{Float, Int}` instead. There is no equivalent to `Zero::is_zero`. Use `(==)` with `{Float, Int}::zero` instead.
    - `Signed::abs_sub` has been moved to `std::num::FloatMath`, and is no longer implemented for signed integers.
    - `core::num::Signed` has been removed, and its methods have been moved to `core::num::Float` and a new trait, `core::num::SignedInt`. The methods now take the `self` parameter by value.
    - `core::num::{Saturating, CheckedAdd, CheckedSub, CheckedMul, CheckedDiv}` have been removed, and their methods moved to `core::num::Int`. Their parameters are now taken by value. This means that
    - `std::time::Duration` no longer implements `core::num::{Zero, CheckedAdd, CheckedSub}` instead defining the required methods non-polymorphically.
    - `core::num::{zero, one, abs, signum}` have been deprecated. Use their respective methods instead.
    - The `core::num::{next_power_of_two, is_power_of_two, checked_next_power_of_two}` functions have been deprecated in favor of methods defined a new trait, `core::num::UnsignedInt`
    - `core::iter::{AdditiveIterator, MultiplicativeIterator}` are now only implemented for the built-in numeric types.
    - `core::iter::{range, range_inclusive, range_step, range_step_inclusive}` now require `core::num::Int` to be implemented for the type they a re parametrized over.

    auto merge of #18557 : aturon/rust/io-removal, r=alexcrichton
    
    This PR includes a sequence of commits that gradually dismantles the `librustrt` `rtio` system -- the main trait previously used to abstract over green and native io. It also largely dismantles `libnative`, moving much of its code into `libstd` and refactoring as it does so.
    
    TL;DR:
    
    * Before this PR: `rustc hello.rs &amp;&amp; wc -c hello` produces 715,996
    * After this PR:  `rustc hello.rs &amp;&amp; wc -c hello` produces 368,100
    
    That is, this PR reduces the footprint of hello world by ~50%.
    
    This is a major step toward #17325 (i.e. toward implementing the [runtime removal RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230).) What remains is to pull out the scheduling, synchronization and task infrastructure, and to remove `libgreen`. These will be done soon in a follow-up PR.
    
    Part of the work here is eliminating the `rtio` abstraction, which in many cases means bringing the implementation of io closer to the actual API presented in `std::io`.
    
    Another aspect of this PR is the creation of two new, *private* modules within `std` that implement io:
    
    * The `sys` module, which represents a platform-specific implementation of a number of low-level abstractions that are used directly within `std::io` and `std::os`. These "abstractions" are left largely the same as they were in `libnative` (except for the removal of `Arc` in file descriptors), but they are expected to evolve greatly over time. Organizationally, there are `sys/unix/` and `sys/windows/` directories which both implement the entire `sys` module hierarchy; this means that nearly all of the platform-specific code is isolated and you can get a handle on each platform in isolation.
    
    * The `sys_common` module, which is rooted at `sys/common`, and provides a few pieces of private, low-level, but cross-platform functionality.
    
    In the long term, the `sys` modules will provide hooks for exposing high-level platform-specific APIs as part of `libstd`. The first such API will be access to file descriptors from `std::io` abstractions, but a bit of design work remains before that step can be taken.
    
    The `sys_common` module includes some traits (like `AsFileDesc`) which allow communication of private details between modules in disparate locations in the hierarchy; this helps overcome the relatively simple hierarchical privacy system in Rust.
    
    To emphasize: the organization in `sys` is *very preliminary* and the main goal was to migrate away from `rtio` as quickly and simply as possible. The design will certainly evolve over time, and all of the details are currently private.
    
    Along the way, this PR also entirely removes signal handling, since it was only supported on `librustuv` which was removed a while ago.
    
    Because of the removal of APIs from `libnative` and `librustrt`, and the removal of signal handling, this is a:
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    Some of these APIs will return in public from from `std` over time.

    Remove rlibc from the distribution
    
    To make progress on #18585 we're paring down the distribution to theoretically
    "only libstd", and this commit makes progress on this by removing the rlibc
    crate from the distribution.
    
    The crate has now been moved into an external cargo package located in the rust

    Implement low-hanging fruit of collection conventions
    
    * Renames/deprecates the simplest and most obvious methods
    * Adds FIXME(conventions)s for outstanding work
    * Marks "handled" methods as unstable
    
    NOTE: the semantics of reserve and reserve_exact have changed!
    Other methods have had their semantics changed as well, but in a
    way that should obviously not typecheck if used incorrectly.
    
    Lots of work and breakage to come, but this handles most of the core
    APIs and most eggregious breakage. Future changes should *mostly* focus on
    niche collections, APIs, or simply back-compat additions.

    auto merge of #18559 : aturon/rust/prelude_cleanup, r=alexcrichton
    
    This commit renames a number of extension traits for slices and string slices, now that they have been refactored for DST. In many cases, multiple extension traits could now be consolidated. Further consolidation will be possible with generalized where clauses.
    
    The renamings are consistent with the [new `-Prelude` suffix](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/344). There are probably a few more candidates for being renamed this way, but that is left for API stabilization of the relevant modules.
    
    Because this renames traits, it is a:

    auto merge of #18467 : japaric/rust/eq, r=alexcrichton
    
    `eq`, `ne`, `cmp`, etc methods now require one less level of indirection when dealing with `&amp;str`/`&amp;[T]`
    
    ``` rust
    "foo".ne(&amp;"bar") -&gt; "foo".ne("bar")
    slice.cmp(&amp;another_slice) -&gt; slice.cmp(another_slice)
    // slice and another_slice have type `&amp;[T]`

    auto merge of #18486 : nikomatsakis/rust/operator-dispatch, r=pcwalton
    
    This branch cleans up overloaded operator resolution so that it is strictly based on the traits in `ops`, rather than going through the normal method lookup mechanism. It also adds full support for autoderef to overloaded index (whereas before autoderef only worked for non-overloaded index) as well as for the slicing operators.
    
    This is a [breaking-change]: in the past, we were accepting combinations of operands that were not intended to be accepted. For example, it was possible to compare a fixed-length array and a slice, or apply the `!` operator to a `&amp;int`. See the first two commits in this pull-request for examples.
    
    One downside of this change is that comparing fixed-length arrays doesn't always work as smoothly as it did before. Before this, comparisons sometimes worked due to various coercions to slices. I've added impls for `Eq`, `Ord`, etc for fixed-lengths arrays up to and including length 32, but if the array is longer than that you'll need to either newtype the array or convert to slices. Note that this plays better with deriving in any case than the previous scheme.
    
    Fixes #4920.
    Fixes #16821.
    Fixes #15757.

    Migrated io::net::udp over to ToSocketAddr
    
    UdpSocket constructor methods now use ToSocketAddr trait instead of
    SocketAddr.

    auto merge of #18592 : alexcrichton/rust/dylib-harder, r=pcwalton
    
    If a dylib is being produced, the compiler will now first check to see if it can
    be created entirely statically before falling back to dynamic dependencies. This
    behavior can be overridden with `-C prefer-dynamic`.
    
    Due to the alteration in behavior, this is a breaking change. Any previous users
    relying on dylibs implicitly maximizing dynamic dependencies should start
    passing `-C prefer-dynamic` to compilations.
    
    Closes #18499
