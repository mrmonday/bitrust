    [breaking-change], needs a crater run.

    Add `Shared` pointer and have `{Arc, Rc}` use it
    
    This change has two consequences:
    
    1. It makes `Arc&lt;T&gt;` and `Rc&lt;T&gt;` covariant in `T`.
    
    2. It causes the compiler to reject code that was unsound with respect
    to dropck. See compile-fail/issue-29106.rs for an example of code that
    no longer compiles. Because of this, this is a [breaking-change].
    
    Fixes #29037.
    Fixes #29106.

    Auto merge of #28669 - arielb1:well-formed-methods, r=nikomatsakis
    
    By RFC1214:
    &gt;    Before calling a fn, we check that its argument and return types are WF.
    
    The previous code only checked the trait-ref, which was not enough
    in several cases.
    
    As this is a soundness fix, it is a [breaking-change]. Some new annotations are needed, which I think are because of #18653 and the imperfection of `projection_must_outlive` (that can probably be worked around by moving the wf obligation later).

    ensure that the types of methods are well-formed
    
    By RFC1214:
    Before calling a fn, we check that its argument and return types are WF. This check takes place after all higher-ranked lifetimes have been instantiated. Checking the argument types ensures that the implied bounds due to argument types are correct. Checking the return type ensures that the resulting type of the call is WF.
    
    The previous code only checked the trait-ref, which was not enough
    in several cases.
    
    As this is a soundness fix, it is a [breaking-change].

    Auto merge of #28742 - nikomatsakis:def-id-encapsulate, r=eddyb
    
    As described in https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1298, the idea here is to make DefIds independent of changes to the content of other items. They are also *mostly* independent from ordering, so e.g. reordering two functions will change the defids, but it will not change the paths that they expand into (but this is not the case for some things, such as impls).
    
    This is a major refactoring, so I did it in slices. The final commit is in some sense The Big One where most of the work is done. The earlier commits just pave the way by gradually refactoring accesses to the `node` field.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] for plugin authors. The things you need to do to migrate your code are as follows:
    
    1. For local def-ids, rather than do `def_id.node`, call `tcx.map.as_local_node_id(def_id)`.
    2. To construct a local def-id, call `tcx.map.local_def_id(node_id)`.
    3. Note that you cannot make def-ids for any node, but only for "definitions" -- which include all items, as well as a number of other things, but not e.g. arbitrary expressions.
    4. You can get the path to a def-id by calling `tcx.def_path(def_id)`.
    
    One thing that is NOT part of this PR, but which I plan do in a follow-up, is converting uses of the existing `with_path` API to use `def_path`, which is basically the same.

    Auto merge of #28605 - alexcrichton:link-native-first, r=brson
    
    This commit swaps the order of linking local native libraries and upstream
    native libraries on the linker command line. Detail of bugs this can cause can
    be found in #28595, and this change also invalidates the test case that was
    added for #12446 which is now considered a bug because the downstream dependency
    would need to declare that it depends on the native library somehow.
    
    Closes #28595

    Auto merge of #28538 - alevy:make_fixedsizearray_unsafe, r=alexcrichton
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    `FixedSizeArray` is meant to be implemented for arrays of fixed size only, but can be implemented for anything at the moment. Marking the trait unsafe would make it more reasonable to write unsafe code which operates on fixed size arrays of any size.
    
    For example, using `uninitialized` to create a fixed size array and immediately filling it with a fixed value is externally safe:
    
    ```
    pub fn init_with_nones&lt;T, A: FixedSizeArray&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;() -&gt; A {
        let mut res = unsafe { mem::uninitialized() };
        for elm in res.as_mut_slice().iter_mut() {
            *elm = None;
        }
        res
    }
    ```
    
    But the same code is not safe if `FixedSizeArray` is implemented for other types:
    
    ```
    struct Foo { foo: usize }
    impl FixedSizeArray&lt;Option&lt;usize&gt;&gt; for Foo {
        fn as_slice(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;[usize] { &amp;[] }
        fn as_mut_slice(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;mut [usize] { &amp;mut [] }
    }
    ```
    
    now `init_with_nones() : Foo` returns a `Foo` with an undefined value for the field `foo`.

    Add `no_default_libraries` target linker option
    
    If set to false, `-nodefaultlibs` is not passed to the linker. This
    was the default behavior on Windows, but it should be configurable
    per target.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] for target specifications that have
    the `is_like_windows` option set to true. Such targets need to
    set `no_default_libraries` to false in order to restore the old
    behavior.

    [breaking-change] for lint authors

    Add an early lint pass for lints that operate on the AST
    
    There is a minor [breaking-change] for lint authors - some functions which were previously defined on `lint::Context` have moved to a trait - `LintContext`, you may need to import that trait to avoid name resolution errors.

    Auto merge of #27856 - nikomatsakis:move-def-id-to-rustc, r=eddyb
    
    It doesn't really make sense for DefId to be in libsyntax -- it is concerned with a single crate only. It is the compiler that understands the idea of many crates. (At some point, there might be a useful intermediate point here.) This is a refactoring in support of incr. compilation, which will be adjusting the notion of a DefId to make it more durable across compilations.
    
    This will probably be a [breaking-change] for every plugin ever. You need to adjust things as follows:
    
        use rustc::middle::def_id::{DefId, LOCAL_CRATE}; // two most common definitions
        ast_util::is_local(def_id) =&gt; def_id.is_local()
        ast_util::local_def(node_id) =&gt; DefId::local(node_id)

    Auto merge of #27307 - rkruppe:dec2flt, r=pnkfelix
    
    Completely rewrite the conversion of decimal strings to `f64` and `f32`. The code is intended to be absolutely positively completely 100% accurate (when it doesn't give up). To the best of my knowledge, it achieves that goal. Any input that is not rejected is converted to the floating point number that is closest to the true value of the input. This includes overflow, subnormal numbers, and underflow to zero. In other words, the rounding error is less than or equal to 0.5 units in the last place. Half-way cases (exactly 0.5 ULP error) are handled with half-to-even rounding, also known as banker's rounding.
    
    This code implements the algorithms from the paper [How to Read Floating Point Numbers Accurately][paper] by William D. Clinger, with extensions to handle underflow, overflow and subnormals, as well as some algorithmic optimizations.
    
    # Correctness
    
    With such a large amount of tricky code, many bugs are to be expected. Indeed tracking down the obscure causes of various rounding errors accounts for the bulk of the development time. Extensive tests (taking in the order of hours to run through to completion) are included in `src/etc/test-float-parse`: Though exhaustively testing all possible inputs is impossible, I've had good success with generating millions of instances from various "classes" of inputs. These tests take far too long to be run by @bors so contributors who touch this code need the discipline to run them. There are `#[test]`s, but they don't even cover every stupid mistake I made in course of writing this.
    
    Another aspect is *integer* overflow. Extreme (or malicious) inputs could cause overflow both in the machine-sized integers used for bookkeeping throughout the algorithms (e.g., the decimal exponent) as well as the arbitrary-precision arithmetic. There is input validation to reject all such cases I know of, and I am quite sure nobody will *accidentally* cause this code to go out of range. Still, no guarantees.
    
    # Limitations
    
    Noticed the weasel words "(when it doesn't give up)" at the beginning? Some otherwise well-formed decimal strings are rejected because spelling out the value of the input requires too many digits, i.e., `digits * 10^abs(exp)` can't be stored in a bignum. This only applies if the value is not "obviously" zero or infinite, i.e., if you take a near-infinity or near-zero value and add many pointless fractional digits. At least with the algorithm used here, computing the precise value would require computing the full value as a fraction, which would overflow. The precise limit is `number_of_digits + abs(exp) &gt; 375` but could be raised almost arbitrarily. In the future, another algorithm might lift this restriction entirely.
    
    This should not be an issue for any realistic inputs. Still, the code does reject inputs that would result in a finite float when evaluated with unlimited precision. Some of these inputs are even regressions that the old code (mostly) handled, such as `0.333...333` with 400+ `3`s. Thus this might qualify as [breaking-change].
    
    # Performance
    
    Benchmarks results are... tolerable. Short numbers that hit the fast paths (`f64` multiplication or shortcuts to zero/inf) have performance in the same order of magnitude as the old code tens of nanoseconds. Numbers that are delegated to Algorithm Bellerophon (using floats with 64 bit significand, implemented in software) are slower, but not drastically so (couple hundred nanoseconds).
    
    Numbers that need the AlgorithmM fallback (for `f64`, roughly everything below 1e-305 and above 1e305) take far, far longer, hundreds of microseconds. Note that my implementation is not quite as naive as the expository version in the paper (it needs one to four division instead of ~1000), but division is fundamentally pretty expensive and my implementation of it is extremely simple and slow.
    
    All benchmarks run on a mediocre laptop with a i5-4200U CPU under light load.
    
    # Binary size
    
    Unfortunately the implementation needs to duplicate almost all code: Once for `f32` and once for `f64`. Before you ask, no, this cannot be avoided, at least not completely (but see the Future Work section). There's also a precomputed table of powers of ten, weighing in at about six kilobytes.
    
    Running a stage1 `rustc` over a stand-alone program that simply parses pi to `f32` and `f64` and outputs both results reveals that the overhead vs. the old parsing code is about 44 KiB normally and about 28 KiB with LTO. It's presumably half of that + 3 KiB when only one of the two code paths is exercised.

    # Future Work
    
    ## Directory layout
    
    The `dec2flt` code uses some types embedded deeply in the `flt2dec` module hierarchy, even though nothing about them it formatting-specific. They should be moved to a more conversion-direction-agnostic location at some point.
    
    ## Performance
    
    It could be much better, especially for large inputs. Some low-hanging fruit has been picked but much more work could be done. Some specific ideas are jotted down in `FIXME`s all over the code.
    
    ## Binary size
    
    One could try to compress the table further, though I am skeptical. Another avenue would be reducing the code duplication from basically everything being generic over `T: RawFloat`. Perhaps one can reduce the magnitude of the duplication by pushing the parts that don't need to know the target type into separate functions, but this is finicky and probably makes some code read less naturally.
    
    ## Other bases
    
    This PR leaves `f{32,64}::from_str_radix` alone. It only replaces `FromStr` (and thus `.parse()`). I am convinced that `from_str_radix` should not exist, and have proposed its [deprecation and speedy removal][deprecate-radix]. Whatever the outcome of that discussion, it is independent from, and out of scope for, this PR.

    `Duration::span` remains unstable, and the `Display` implementation for
    `Duration` has been removed as it is still being reworked and all trait

    I'm opening this PR as a platform for discussion - there may be some method renaming to do as part of the stabilization process.

    Accurate decimal-to-float parsing routines.
    
    This commit primarily adds implementations of the algorithms from William
    Clinger's paper "How to Read Floating Point Numbers Accurately". It also
    includes a lot of infrastructure necessary for those algorithms, and some
    unit tests.
    
    Since these algorithms reject a few (extreme) inputs that were previously
    accepted, this could be seen as a [breaking-change]

    Auto merge of #26173 - pnkfelix:fsk-trans-nzmove-take3, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Add dropflag hints (stack-local booleans) for unfragmented paths in trans.  Part of #5016.
    
    Added code to maintain these hints at runtime, and to conditionalize drop-filling and calls to destructors.
    
    In this early stage of my incremental implementation strategy, we are using hints, so we are always free to leave out a flag for a path -- then we just pass `None` as the dropflag hint in the corresponding schedule cleanup call. But, once a path has a hint, we must at least maintain it: i.e. if the hint exists, we must ensure it is never set to "moved" if the data in question might actually have been initialized. It remains sound to conservatively set the hint to "initialized" as long as the true drop-flag embedded in the value itself is up-to-date.
    
    I hope the commit series has been broken up to be readable; most of the commits in the series should build (though I did not always check this).
    
    ----
    
    Oh, I think this technically qualifies as a:
    [breaking-change]
    because it removes drop-filling in some cases where one could previously observe it. That should only affect `unsafe` code; no safe code should be able to inspect whether the drop-fill was present or not. For an example of code that needed to change to account for this, see commit a81c24ae0216ab47df59acd724f8a33124fb6d97 (a unit test of the `move_val_init` intrinsic).  I have not encountered actual code that needed to be updated to account for the change, since this should only be skipping the drop-filling on *moved* values, not on dropped one, and so even types that use `unsafe_no_drop_flag` should be unchanged by this particular PR. (Their time will come later.)

    Transition to the new object lifetime defaults, replacing the old defaults completely.
    
    r? @pnkfelix
    
    This is a [breaking-change] as specified by [RFC 1156][1156] (though all cases that would break should have been receiving warnings starting in Rust 1.2). Types like `&amp;'a Box&lt;Trait&gt;` (or `&amp;'a Rc&lt;Trait&gt;`, etc) will change from being interpreted as `&amp;'a Box&lt;Trait+'a&gt;` to `&amp;'a Box&lt;Trait+'static&gt;`. To restore the old behavior, write the `+'a` explicitly. For example, the function:
    
    
    ```rust
    trait Trait { }
    fn foo(x: &amp;Box&lt;Trait&gt;) { ... }
    ```
    
    would be rewritten as:
    
    ```rust
    trait Trait { }
    fn foo(x: &amp;'a Box&lt;Trait+'a&gt;) { ... }
    ```
    
    if one wanted to preserve the current typing.

    Auto merge of #26326 - nikomatsakis:optimize-fulfillment-cache-in-tcx, r=pcwalton
    
    When we successfully resolve a trait reference with no type/lifetime parameters, like `i32: Foo` or `Box&lt;u32&gt;: Sized`, this is in fact globally true. This patch adds a simple global to the tcx to cache such cases. The main advantage of this is really about caching things like `Box&lt;Vec&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;: Sized`. It also points to the need to revamp our caching infrastructure -- the current caches make selection cost cheaper, but we still wind up paying a high cost in the confirmation process, and in particular unrolling out dependent obligations. Moreover, we should probably do caching more uniformly and with a key that takes the where-clauses into account. But that's for later.
    
    For me, this shows up as a reasonably nice win (20%) on Servo's script crate (when built in dev mode). This is not as big as my initial measurements suggested, I think because I was building my rustc with more debugging enabled at the time. I've not yet done follow-up profiling and so forth to see where the new hot spots are. Bootstrap times seem to be largely unaffected.
    
    cc @pcwalton
    
    This is technically a [breaking-change] in that functions with unsatisfiable where-clauses may now yield errors where before they may have been accepted. Even before, these functions could never have been *called* by actual code. In the future, such functions will probably become illegal altogether, but in this commit they are still accepted, so long as they do not rely on the unsatisfiable where-clauses. As before, the functions still cannot be called in any case.

    Mark Arc function get_mut and method make_unique unsafe
    
    This is a temporary mitigation for issue #24880 which points out that
    these functions are racy in a particular situation where weak pointers
    exist.
    
    To mitigate this, mark the functions unsafe until this can be fixed or
    another decision is made.
    
    This is a breaking change to unstable API, because the new version
    requires an `unsafe` block. Review carefully if weak pointers may race
    for any uses of this API and consider abandoning it.

    Auto merge of #24612 - lifthrasiir:flt2dec, r=pnkfelix
    
    This is a direct port of my prior work on the float formatting. The detailed description is available [here](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-strconv#flt2dec). In brief,
    
    * This adds a new hidden module `core::num::flt2dec` for testing from `libcoretest`. Why is it in `core::num` instead of `core::fmt`? Because I envision that the table used by `flt2dec` is directly applicable to `dec2flt` (cf. #24557) as well, which exceeds the realm of "formatting".
    * This contains both Dragon4 algorithm (exact, complete but slow) and Grisu3 algorithm (exact, fast but incomplete).
    * The code is accompanied with a large amount of self-tests and some exhaustive tests. In particular, `libcoretest` gets a new dependency on `librand`. For the external interface it relies on the existing test suite.
    * It is known that, in the best case, the entire formatting code has about 30 KBs of binary overhead (judged from strconv experiments). Not too bad but there might be a potential room for improvements.
    
    This is rather large code. I did my best to comment and annotate the code, but you have been warned.
    
    For the maximal availability the original code was licensed in CC0, but I've also dual-licensed it in MIT/Apache as well so there should be no licensing concern.
    
    This is [breaking-change] as it changes the float output slightly (and it also affects the casing of `inf` and `nan`). I hope this is not a big deal though :)
    
    Fixes #7030, #18038 and #24556. Also related to #6220 and #20870.
    
    ## Known Issues
    
    - [x] I've yet to finish `make check-stage1`. It does pass main test suites including `run-pass` but there might be some unknown edges on the doctests.
    - [ ] Figure out how this PR affects rustc.
    - [ ] Determine which internal routine is mapped to the formatting specifier. Depending on the decision, some internal routine can be safely removed (for instance, currently `to_shortest_str` is unused).

    dropck: must assume `Box&lt;Trait + 'a&gt;` has a destructor of interest.
    
    Fix #25199.
    
    This detail was documented in [RFC 769]; the implementation was just missing.
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    The breakage here falls into both obvious and non-obvious cases.
    
    The obvious case: if you were relying on the unsoundness this exposes (namely being able to reference dead storage from a destructor, by doing it via a boxed trait object bounded by the lifetime of the dead storage), then this change disallows that.
    
    The non-obvious cases: The way dropck works, it causes lifetimes to be extended to longer extents than they covered before. I.e.  lifetimes that are attached as trait-bounds may become longer than they were previously.
    
    * This includes lifetimes that are only *implicitly* attached as trait-bounds (due to [RFC 599]). So you may have code that was e.g. taking a parameter of type `&amp;'a Box&lt;Trait&gt;` (which expands to `&amp;'a Box&lt;Trait+'a&gt;`), that now may need to be assigned type `&amp;'a Box&lt;Trait+'static&gt;` to ensure that `'a` is not inadvertantly inferred to a region that is actually too long.

    Auto merge of #25006 - alexcrichton:unstable-indexing, r=aturon
    
    These implementations were intended to be unstable, but currently the stability
    attributes cannot handle a stable trait with an unstable `impl` block. This
    commit also audits the rest of the standard library for explicitly-`#[unstable]`
    impl blocks. No others were removed but some annotations were changed to
    `#[stable]` as they're defacto stable anyway.
    
    One particularly interesting `impl` marked `#[stable]` as part of this commit
    is the `Add&lt;&amp;[T]&gt;` impl for `Vec&lt;T&gt;`, which uses `push_all` and implicitly
    clones all elements of the vector provided.

    Auto merge of #24793 - aturon:io-error-any, r=alexcrichton
    
    This commit brings the `Error` trait in line with the [Error interoperation
    RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/201) by adding downcasting,
    which has long been intended. This change means that for any `Error`
    trait objects that are `'static`, you can downcast to concrete error
    types.
    
    To make this work, it is necessary for `Error` to inherit from
    `Reflect` (which is currently used to mark concrete types as "permitted
    for reflection, aka downcasting"). This is a breaking change: it means
    that impls like
    
    ```rust
    impl&lt;T&gt; Error for MyErrorType&lt;T&gt; { ... }
    ```
    
    must change to
    
    ```rust
    impl&lt;T: Reflect&gt; Error for MyErrorType&lt;T&gt; { ... }
    ```
    
    This commit furthermore marks `Reflect` as stable, since we are already
    essentially committed to it via `Any`. Note that in the future, if we
    determine that the parametricity aspects of `Reflect` are not needed, we
    can deprecate the trait and provide a blanket implementation for it
    for *all* types (rather than by using OIBIT), which would allow all
    mentions of `Reflect` to be dropped over time. So there is not a strong
    commitment here.

    Add downcasting to std::error::Error

    which has long been intended. This change means that for any `Error`

    must change to something like
    
    ```rust
    impl&lt;T: Reflect&gt; Error for MyErrorType&lt;T&gt; { ... }
    ```
    
    except that `Reflect` is currently unstable (and should remain so for
    the time being). For now, code can instead bound by `Any`:
    
    ```rust
    impl&lt;T: Any&gt; Error for MyErrorType&lt;T&gt; { ... }
    ```
    
    which *is* stable and has `Reflect` as a super trait. The downside is
    that this imposes a `'static` constraint, but that only
    constrains *when* `Error` is implemented -- it does not actually
    constrain the types that can implement `Error`.

    using `T:Copy` for one of its type parameters and is relying on the
    Drop Check rule not applying to it.
    
    Here is an example:
    
    ```rust
    #![allow(dead_code,unused_variables,unused_assignments)]
    struct D&lt;T:Copy&gt;(T);
    impl&lt;T:Copy&gt; Drop for D&lt;T&gt; { fn drop(&amp;mut self) { } }
    
    trait UserT { fn c(&amp;self) { } }
    impl&lt;T:Copy&gt; UserT for T { }
    struct E&lt;T:UserT&gt;(T);
    impl&lt;T:UserT&gt; Drop for E&lt;T&gt; { fn drop(&amp;mut self) { } }
    
    // This one will start breaking.
    fn foo() { let (d2, d1); d1 = D(34); d2 = D(&amp;d1); }
    
    #[cfg(this_one_does_and_should_always_break)]
    fn bar() { let (e2, e1); e1 = E(34); e2 = E(&amp;e1); }

        foo();
    }

    Inspect enum discriminant *after* calling its destructor
    
    Includes some drive-by cleanup (e.g. changed some field and method names to reflect fill-on-drop; added comments about zero-variant enums being classified as `_match::Single`).
    
    Probably the most invasive change was the expansion of the maps `available_drop_glues` and `drop_glues` to now hold two different kinds of drop glues; there is the (old) normal drop glue, and there is (new) drop-contents glue that jumps straight to dropping the contents of a struct or enum, skipping its destructor.
    
     * For all types that do not have user-defined Drop implementations, the normal glue is generated as usual (i.e. recursively dropping the fields of the data structure).
    
      (And this actually is exactly what the newly-added drop-contents glue does as well.)
    
     * For types that have user-defined Drop implementations, the "normal" drop glue now schedules a cleanup before invoking the `Drop::drop` method that will call the drop-contents glue after that invocation returns.
    
    Fix #23611.
    
    ----
    
    Is this a breaking change?  The prior behavior was totally unsound, and it seems unreasonable that anyone was actually relying on it.
    
    Nonetheless, since there is a user-visible change to the language semantics, I guess I will conservatively mark this as a:

    The `ToSource` trait is removed. Quasiquote no longer involves pretty-printing at all, which removes the need for the `encode_with_hygiene` hack. All associated machinery is removed.
    
    New `Nonterminal`s are added: NtArm, NtImplItem, and NtTraitItem. These are just for quasiquote, not macros.
    
    `ToTokens` is no longer implemented for `Arg` (although this could be added again) and `Generics` (which I don't think makes sense).

    This commit removes all the old casting/generic traits from `std::num` that are
    no longer in use by the standard library. This additionally removes the old
    `strconv` module which has not seen much use in quite a long time. All generic
    functionality has been supplanted with traits in the `num` crate and the
    `strconv` module is supplanted with the [rust-strconv crate][rust-strconv].

    De-stabilize `thread::scoped` and friends
    
    Issue #24292 demonstrates that the `scoped` API as currently offered can
    be memory-unsafe: the `JoinGuard` can be moved into a context that will
    fail to execute destructors prior to the stack frame being popped (for
    example, by creating an `Rc` cycle).
    
    This commit reverts the APIs to `unstable` status while a long-term
    solution is worked out.
    
    (There are several possible ways to address this issue; it's not a
    fundamental problem with the `scoped` idea, but rather an indication
    that Rust doesn't currently provide a good way to ensure that
    destructors are run within a particular stack frame.)

    We provide tools to tell what exact symbols to emit for any fn or static, but
    don’t quite check if that won’t cause any issues later on. Some of the issues
    include LLVM mangling our names again and our names pointing to wrong locations,
    us generating dumb foreign call wrappers, linker errors, extern functions
    resolving to different symbols altogether (`extern {fn fail();} fail();` in some
    cases calling `fail1()`), etc.
    
    Before the commit we had a function called `note_unique_llvm_symbol`, so it is
    clear somebody was aware of the issue at some point, but the function was barely
    used, mostly in irrelevant locations.
    
    Along with working on it I took liberty to start refactoring trans/base into
    a few smaller modules. The refactoring is incomplete and I hope I will find some
    motivation to carry on with it.
    
    This is possibly a [breaking-change] because it makes dumbly written code
    properly invalid.
    
    This fixes all those issues about incorrect use of #[no_mangle] being not reported/misreported/ICEd by the compiler.
    
    NB. This PR does not attempt to tackle the parallel codegen issue that was mentioned in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22811, but I believe it should be very straightforward in a follow up PR by modifying `trans::declare::get_defined_value` to look at all the contexts.

    This is a [breaking-change] because it can change the result of comparison operators when enum discriminants have been explicitly assigned.  Notably in a case like:
    ```rust
    #[derive(PartialOrd)]
    enum E { A = 2, B = 1}
    ```
    
    Under the old deriving, `A &lt; B` held, because `A` came before `B` in the order of declaration.  But now we use the ordering according to the provided values, and thus `A &gt; B`.  (However, this change is very unlikely to break much, if any, code, since the orderings themselves should all remain well-defined, total, etc.)

    std: Set CLOEXEC for all fds opened on unix
    
    This commit starts to set the CLOEXEC flag for all files and sockets opened by
    the standard library by default on all unix platforms. There are a few points of
    note in this commit:
    
    * The implementation is not 100% satisfactory in the face of threads. File
      descriptors only have the `F_CLOEXEC` flag set *after* they are opened,
      allowing for a fork/exec to happen in the middle and leak the descriptor.
      Some platforms do support atomically opening a descriptor while setting the
      `CLOEXEC` flag, and it is left as a future extension to bind these apis as it
      is unclear how to do so nicely at this time.
    
    * The implementation does not offer a method of opting into the old behavior of
      not setting `CLOEXEC`. This will possibly be added in the future through
      extensions on `OpenOptions`, for example.
    
    * This change does not yet audit any Windows APIs to see if the handles are
      inherited by default by accident.
    
    This is a breaking change for users who call `fork` or `exec` outside of the
    standard library itself and expect file descriptors to be inherted. All file
    descriptors created by the standard library will no longer be inherited.

    std: Make FromRawFd::from_raw_fd an unsafe method
    
    As pointed out in [RFC issue 1043][rfc] it is quite useful to have the standard
    I/O types to provide the contract that they are the sole owner of the underlying
    object they represent. This guarantee enables writing safe interfaces like the
    `MemoryMap` API sketched out in that issue.
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1043
    
    As constructing objects from these raw handles may end up violating these
    ownership gurantees, the functions for construction are now marked unsafe.
    
    [breaking-change]
    Closes rust-lang/rfcs#1043

    Rollup merge of #24212 - alexcrichton:destabilize-begin-unwind, r=huonw
    
     Now that we have a `#[allow_internal_unstable]` attribute for macros there's no
    need for these two `begin_unwind` functions to be stable. Right now the `panic!`
    interface is the only one we wish to stabilize, so remove the stability markers
    from these functions.
    
    While this is a breaking change, it is highly unlikely to break any actual code.
    It is recommended to use the `panic!` macro instead if it breaks explicit calls
    into `std::rt`.

    Improve bounds in Iterator API
    
    This commit changes `Iterator`'s API by:
    
    * Generalizing bounds from `Iterator` to `IntoIterator` whenever
      possible, matching the semantics and ergonomics of `for` loops.
    
    * Tightens up a few method-level bounds so that you get an error
      earlier. For example, `rev` did not require `DoubleEndedIterator` even
      though the result is only an `Iterator` when the original iterator was
      double-ended.
    
    Closes #23587
    
    The bound-tightening is technically a:
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    but no code should break in practice.

    std: Fix fs::read_link behavior on Windows
    
    The current implementation of using GetFinalPathNameByHandle actually reads all
    intermediate links instead of just looking at the current link. This commit
    alters the behavior of the function to use a different API which correctly reads
    only one level of the soft link.

    Make `sum` and `product` inherent methods on `Iterator`
    
    In addition to being nicer, this also allows you to use `sum` and `product` for
    iterators yielding custom types aside from the standard integers.
    
    Due to removing the `AdditiveIterator` and `MultiplicativeIterator` trait, this
    is a breaking change.

    Add `Sync` to the bounds in `io::Error`
    
    This allows `io::Error` values to be stored in `Arc` properly.

    and modifies the relevant `convert::From` impls, this is a

    Introduce trans::declare
    
    We provide tools to tell what exact symbols to emit for any fn or static, but
    don’t quite check if that won’t cause any issues later on. Some of the issues
    include LLVM mangling our names again and our names pointing to wrong locations,
    us generating dumb foreign call wrappers, linker errors, extern functions
    resolving to different symbols altogether (extern {fn fail();} fail(); in some
    cases calling fail1()), etc.
    
    Before the commit we had a function called note_unique_llvm_symbol, so it is
    clear somebody was aware of the issue at some point, but the function was barely
    used, mostly in irrelevant locations.
    
    Along with working on it I took liberty to start refactoring trans/base into
    a few smaller modules. The refactoring is incomplete and I hope I will find some
    motivation to carry on with it.
    
    This is possibly a [breaking-change] because it makes dumbly written code
    properly invalid.

    Auto merge of #23832 - petrochenkov:usize, r=aturon
    
    These constants are small and can fit even in `u8`, but semantically they have type `usize` because they denote sizes and are almost always used in `usize` context. The change of their type to `u32` during the integer audit led only to the large amount of `as usize` noise (see the second commit, which removes this noise).
    
    This is a minor [breaking-change] to an unstable interface.

    rollup merge of #23949: aturon/stab-timeout
    
    This commit renames and stabilizes:
    
    * `Condvar::wait_timeout_ms` (renamed from `wait_timeout`)
    * `thread::park_timeout_ms` (renamed from `park_timeout`)
    * `thread::sleep_ms` (renamed from `sleep`)
    
    In each case, the timeout is taken as a `u32` number of milliseconds,
    rather than a `Duration`.
    
    These functions are likely to be deprecated once a stable form of
    `Duration` is available, but there is little cost to having these named
    variants around, and it's crucial functionality for 1.0.
