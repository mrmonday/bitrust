    Rollup merge of #22876 - Florob:const, r=nikomatsakis
    
     This changes the type of some public constants/statics in libunicode.
    Notably some `&amp;'static &amp;'static [(char, char)]` have changed
    to `&amp;'static [(char, char)]`. The regexp crate seems to be the
    sole user of these, yet this is technically a [breaking-change]

    Rollup merge of #22990 - japaric:privATe, r=alexcrichton
    
     Associated types are now treated as part of the public API by the privacy checker.
    
    If you were exposing a private type in your public API via an associated type, make that type public:
    
    ``` diff
      pub struct PublicType { .. }
    
    - struct Struct { .. }
    + pub struct Struct { .. }
    
      pub trait PublicTrait {
          type Output;
    
          fn foo(&amp;self) -&gt; Self::Output;
      }
    
      impl PublicTrait for PublicType {
          type Output = Struct;
    
          fn foo(&amp;self) -&gt; Struct {  // `Struct` is part of the public API, it must be marked as `pub`lic
              ..
          }
      }
    ```

    Rollup merge of #22943 - ipetkov:lint-recursion, r=alexcrichton
    
     * The lint visitor's visit_ty method did not recurse, and had a
      reference to the now closed #10894
    * The newly enabled recursion has only affected the `deprectated` lint
      which now detects uses of deprecated items in trait impls and
      function return types
    * Renamed some references to `CowString` and `CowVec` to `Cow&lt;str&gt;` and
      `Cow&lt;[T]&gt;`, respectively, which appear outside of the crate which
      defines them
    * Replaced a few instances of `InvariantType&lt;T&gt;` with
      `PhantomData&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;`
    * Disabled the `deprecated` lint in several places that
      reference/implement traits on deprecated items which will get cleaned
      up in the future
    * Unfortunately, this means that if a library declares
      `#![deny(deprecated)]` and marks anything as deprecated, it will have
      to disable the lint for any uses of said item, e.g. any impl the now
      deprecated item
    
    For any library that denies deprecated items but has deprecated items
    of its own, this is a [breaking-change]
    
    I had originally intended for the lint to ignore uses of deprecated items that are declared in the same crate, but this goes against some previous test cases that expect the lint to capture *all* uses of deprecated items, so I maintained the previous approach to avoid changing the expected behavior of the lint.
    
    Tested locally on OS X, so hopefully there aren't any deprecated item uses behind a `cfg` that I may have missed.

    * count_ones/zeros, trailing_ones/zeros return u32, not usize
    * rotate_left/right take u32, not usize
    * RADIX, MANTISSA_DIGITS, DIGITS, BITS, BYTES are u32, not usize
    
    Doesn't touch pow because there's another PR for it.

    * Disabled the `exceeding_bitshifts` lint for

      error on 32bit systems
    * Unfortunately, this means that if a library declares

    std: Stabilize the `process` module
    
    This commits blanket marks the API of the `std::process` module as `#[stable]`.
    The module's API is very similar to the old `std::old_io::process` API and has
    generally had quite a bit of time to bake both before and after the new module
    landed.
    
    The one modification made to the API is that `Stdio::capture` is now named
    `stdio::piped`.

    Rollup merge of #22907 - dotdash:static_assert_bool, r=eddyb
    
     static_assert is documented as working on static with type `bool`, but
    we currently accept it on any const static and crash when the const has
    an non-integral type.
    
    This is a breaking-change for anyone who used static_assert on types
    likes i32, which happened to work but seems like an unintended
    consequence of the missing error checking.

    Auto merge of #22801 - huonw:crateify-lint, r=kmcallister
    
    This pulls out the implementations of most built-in lints into a
    separate crate, to reduce edit-compile-test iteration times with
    librustc_lint and increase parallelism. This should enable lints to be
    refactored, added and deleted much more easily as it slashes the
    edit-compile cycle to get a minimal working compiler to test with (`make
    rustc-stage1`) from
    
        librustc -&gt; librustc_typeck -&gt; ... -&gt; librustc_driver -&gt;
            libcore -&gt; ... -&gt; libstd
    
    to
    
        librustc_lint -&gt; librustc_driver -&gt; libcore -&gt; ... libstd
    
    which is significantly faster, mainly due to avoiding the librustc build
    itself.
    
    The intention would be to move as much as possible of the infrastructure
    into the crate too, but the plumbing is deeply intertwined with librustc
    itself at the moment. Also, there are lints for which diagnostics are
    registered directly in the compiler code, not in their own crate
    traversal, and their definitions have to remain in librustc.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] for direct users of the compiler APIs:
    callers of `rustc::session::build_session` or
    `rustc::session::build_session_` need to manually call
    `rustc_lint::register_builtins` on their return value.
    
    This should make #22206 easier.

    Rollup merge of #22727 - alexcrichton:prep-env, r=aturon
    
     This commit moves `std::env` away from the `std::old_io` error type as well as
    the `std::old_path` module. Methods returning an error now return `io::Error`
    and methods consuming or returning paths use `std::path` instead of
    `std::old_path`. This commit does not yet mark these APIs as `#[stable]`.
    
    This commit also migrates `std::old_io::TempDir` to `std::fs::TempDir` with
    essentially the exact same API. This type was added to interoperate with the new
    path API and has its own `tempdir` feature.
    
    Finally, this commit reverts the deprecation of `std::os` APIs returning the old
    path API types. This deprecation can come back once the entire `std::old_path`
    module is deprecated.

    Auto merge of #22172 - eddyb:almost-there, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Adds `&lt;module::Type&gt;::method` support and makes `module::Type::method` a shorthand for it.
    This is most of #16293, except that chaining multiple associated types is not yet supported.
    It also fixes #22563 as `impl`s are no longer treated as modules in resolve.
    
    Unfortunately, this is still a *[breaking-change]*:
    * If you used a global path to a primitive type, i.e. `::bool`, `::i32` etc. - that was a bug I had to fix.
    Solution: remove the leading `::`.
    * If you passed explicit `impl`-side type parameters to an inherent method, e.g.:
    ```rust
    struct Foo&lt;T&gt;(T);
    impl&lt;A, B&gt; Foo&lt;(A, B)&gt; {
        fn pair(a: A, b: B) -&gt; Foo&lt;(A, B)&gt; { Foo((a, b)) }
    }
    Foo::&lt;A, B&gt;::pair(a, b)
    // Now that is sugar for:
    &lt;Foo&lt;A, B&gt;&gt;::pair(a, b)
    // Which isn't valid because `Foo` has only one type parameter.
    // Solution: replace with:
    Foo::&lt;(A, B)&gt;::pair(a, b)
    // And, if possible, remove the explicit type param entirely:
    Foo::pair(a, b)
    ```
    * If you used the `QPath`-related `AstBuilder` methods @hugwijst added in #21943.
    The methods still exist, but `QPath` was replaced by `QSelf`, with the actual path stored separately.
    Solution: unpack the pair returned by `cx.qpath` to get the two arguments for `cx.expr_qpath`.

    Stabilize std::borrow
    
    This commit stabilizes `std::borrow`, making the following modifications
    to catch up the API with language changes:
    
    * It renames `BorrowFrom` to `Borrow`, as was originally intended (but
      blocked for technical reasons), and reorders the parameters
      accordingly.
    
    * It moves the type parameter of `ToOwned` to an associated type. This
      is somewhat less flexible, in that each borrowed type must have a
      unique owned type, but leads to a significant simplification for
      `Cow`. Flexibility can be regained by using newtyped slices, which is
      advisable for other reasons anyway.
    
    * It removes the owned type parameter from `Cow`, making the type much
      less verbose.
    
    * Deprecates the `is_owned` and `is_borrowed` predicates in favor of
      direct matching.
    
    The above API changes are relatively minor; the basic functionality
    remains the same, and essentially the whole module is now marked
    `#[stable]`.

    rollup merge of #22482: alexcrichton/cstr-changes
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 592][r592] and [RFC 840][r840]. These
    two RFCs tweak the behavior of `CString` and add a new `CStr` unsized slice type
    to the module.
    
    [r592]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0592-c-str-deref.md
    [r840]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0840-no-panic-in-c-string.md
    
    The new `CStr` type is only constructable via two methods:
    
    1. By `deref`'ing from a `CString`
    2. Unsafely via `CStr::from_ptr`
    
    The purpose of `CStr` is to be an unsized type which is a thin pointer to a
    `libc::c_char` (currently it is a fat pointer slice due to implementation
    limitations). Strings from C can be safely represented with a `CStr` and an
    appropriate lifetime as well. Consumers of `&amp;CString` should now consume `&amp;CStr`
    instead to allow producers to pass in C-originating strings instead of just
    Rust-allocated strings.
    
    A new constructor was added to `CString`, `new`, which takes `T: IntoBytes`
    instead of separate `from_slice` and `from_vec` methods (both have been
    deprecated in favor of `new`). The `new` method returns a `Result` instead of
    panicking.  The error variant contains the relevant information about where the
    error happened and bytes (if present). Conversions are provided to the
    `io::Error` and `old_io::IoError` types via the `FromError` trait which
    translate to `InvalidInput`.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the modification of existing `#[unstable]` APIs
    and new deprecation, and more detailed information can be found in the two RFCs.
    Notable breakage includes:
    
    * All construction of `CString` now needs to use `new` and handle the outgoing
      `Result`.
    * Usage of `CString` as a byte slice now explicitly needs a `.as_bytes()` call.
    * The `as_slice*` methods have been removed in favor of just having the
      `as_bytes*` methods.

    rollup merge of #22208: aturon/expose-more-path
    
    This commit exposes the `is_sep` function and `MAIN_SEP` constant, as
    well as Windows path prefixes. The path prefix enum is safely exposed on
    all platforms, but it only yielded as a component for Windows.
    
    Exposing the prefix enum as part of prefix components involved changing
    the type from `OsStr` to the `Prefix` enum, which is a:

    rollup merge of #22024: alexcrichton/ascii
    
    * Move the type parameter on the `AsciiExt` trait to an associated type named
      `Owned`.
    * Move `ascii::escape_default` to using an iterator.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the removal of the type parameter on the
    `AsciiExt` trait as well as the modifications to the `escape_default` function
    to returning an iterator. Manual implementations of `AsciiExt` (or `AsciiExt`
    bounds) should be adjusted to remove the type parameter and using the new
    `escape_default` should be relatively straightforward.

    Revise std::thread semantics
    
    This commit makes several changes to `std::thread` in preparation for
    final stabilization:
    
    * It removes the ability to handle panics from `scoped` children; see
      #20807 for discussion
    
    * It adds a `JoinHandle` structure, now returned from `spawn`, which
      makes it possible to join on children that do not share data from
      their parent's stack. The child is automatically detached when the
      handle is dropped, and the handle cannot be copied due to Posix
      semantics.
    
    * It moves all static methods from `std::thread::Thread` to free
      functions in `std::thread`. This was done in part because, due to the
      above changes, there are effectively no direct `Thread` constructors,
      and the static methods have tended to feel a bit awkward.
    
    * Adds an `io::Result` around the `Builder` methods `scoped` and
      `spawn`, making it possible to handle OS errors when creating
      threads. The convenience free functions entail an unwrap.
    
    * Stabilizes the entire module. Despite the fact that the API is
      changing somewhat here, this is part of a long period of baking and
      the changes are addressing all known issues prior to alpha2. If
      absolutely necessary, further breaking changes can be made prior to beta.
    
    Closes #20807

    std: Rename io/path features with old_ prefix
    
    This commit renames the features for the `std::old_io` and `std::old_path`
    modules to `old_io` and `old_path` to help facilitate migration to the new APIs.
    
    This is a breaking change as crates which mention the old feature names now need
    to be renamed to use the new feature names.

    std: Stabilize the `ascii` module
    
    This commit performs a stabilization pass over the `std::ascii` module taking
    the following actions:
    
    * the module name is now stable
    * `AsciiExt` is now stable after moving its type parameter to an `Owned`
      associated type
    * `AsciiExt::is_ascii` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::to_ascii_uppercase` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::to_ascii_lowercase` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::eq_ignore_ascii_case` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::make_ascii_uppercase` is added to possibly replace
      `OwnedAsciiExt::into_ascii_uppercase` (similarly for lowercase variants).
    * `escape_default` now returns an iterator and is stable
    * `EscapeDefault` is now stable
    
    Trait implementations are now also marked stable.
    
    Primarily it is still unstable to *implement* the `AsciiExt` trait due to it
    containing some unstable methods.

    Rollup merge of #22313 - japaric:iter, r=aturon
    
     `IntoIterator` now has an extra associated item:
    
    ``` rust
    trait IntoIterator {
        type Item;
        type IntoIter: Iterator&lt;Self=Self::Item&gt;;
    }
    ```
    
    This lets you bind the iterator \"`Item`\" directly when writing generic functions:
    
    ``` rust
    // hypothetical change, not included in this PR
    impl Extend&lt;T&gt; for Vec&lt;T&gt; {
        // you can now write
        fn extend&lt;I&gt;(&amp;mut self, it: I) where I: IntoIterator&lt;Item=T&gt; { .. }
        // instead of
        fn extend&lt;I: IntoIterator&gt;(&amp;mut self, it: I) where I::IntoIter: Iterator&lt;Item=T&gt; { .. }
    }
    ```
    
    The downside is that now you have to write an extra associated type in your `IntoIterator` implementations:
    
    ``` diff
     impl&lt;T&gt; IntoIterator for Vec&lt;T&gt; {
    +    type Item = T;
         type IntoIter = IntoIter&lt;T&gt;;
    
         fn into_iter(self) -&gt; IntoIter&lt;T&gt; { .. }
     }
    ```
    
    Because this breaks all downstream implementations of `IntoIterator`, this is a [breaking-change]

    Fix fallout in libsyntax from RFC 599. Clarity and efficiency seems to be mostly improved, to my eye.
    Nonetheless, as this commit demonstrates, the previous commits was a [breaking-change].
    
    In practice, breakage is focused on functions of this form:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo(..., object: Box&lt;FnMut()&gt;)
    ````
    
    where `FnMut()` could be any trait object type. The older scheme defaulted objects in argument
    position so that they were bounded by a fresh lifetime:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(..., object: Box&lt;FnMut()+'a&gt;)
    ```
    
    This meant that the object could contain borrowed data. The newer
    scheme defaults to a lifetime bound of `'static`:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo(..., object: Box&lt;FnMut()+'static&gt;)
    ```
    
    This means that the object cannot contain borrowed data. In some cases, the best fix
    is to stop using `Box`:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo(..., object: &amp;mut FnMut())
    ```
    
    but another option is to write an explicit annotation for the `'a`
    lifetime that used to be implicit.  Both fixes are demonstrated in
    this commit.

    Rollup merge of #22299 - bluss:range-64-is-not-exact-size, r=alexcrichton
    
     Fixes #22047
    
    `Range&lt;u64&gt;` and `Range&lt;i64&gt;` may be longer than usize::MAX on 32-bit
    platforms, and thus they cannot fulfill the protocol for
    ExactSizeIterator. We don't want a nonobvious platform dependency in
    basic iterator traits, so the trait impl is removed.
    
    The logic of this change assumes that usize is at least 32-bit.
    
    This is technically a breaking change; note that `Range&lt;usize&gt;` and
    `Range&lt;isize&gt;` are always ExactSizeIterators.

    Remove ExactSizeIterator from 64-bit ranges.
    
    Fixes #22047
    
    Range&lt;u64&gt; and Range&lt;i64&gt; may be longer than usize::MAX on 32-bit
    platforms, and thus they cannot fulfill the protocol for
    ExactSizeIterator. We don't want a nonobvious platform dependency in
    basic iterator traits, so the trait impl is removed.
    
    The logic of this change assumes that usize is at least 32-bit.
    
    This is technically a breaking change; note that Range&lt;usize&gt; and
    Range&lt;isize&gt; are always ExactSizeIterators.

    librustc: Forbid partial reinitialization of uninitialized structures or
    enumerations that implement the `Drop` trait.
    
    This breaks code like:
    
        struct Struct {
            f: String,
            g: String,
        }
    
        impl Drop for Struct { ... }
    
        fn main() {
            let x = Struct { ... };
            drop(x);
            x.f = ...;
        }
    
    Change this code to not create partially-initialized structures. For
    example:
    
        struct Struct {
            f: String,
            g: String,
        }
    
        impl Drop for Struct { ... }

                g: ...,

    * `env::var` was renamed to `env::var_os`

    as well as "the default". This is also a breaking change due to the differences
    of what's yielded from each of these functions, but migration should be fairly

    rustc: Fix a number of stability lint holes
    
    There are a number of holes that the stability lint did not previously cover,
    including:
    
    * Types
    * Bounds on type parameters on functions and impls
    * Where clauses
    * Imports
    * Patterns (structs and enums)
    
    These holes have all been fixed by overriding the `visit_path` function on the
    AST visitor instead of a few specialized cases. This change also necessitated a
    few stability changes:
    
    * The `collections::fmt` module is now stable (it was already supposed to be).
    * The `thread_local::imp::Key` type is now stable (it was already supposed to
      be).
    * The `std::rt::{begin_unwind, begin_unwind_fmt}` functions are now stable.
      These are required via the `panic!` macro.
    * The `std::old_io::stdio::{println, println_args}` functions are now stable.
      These are required by the `print!` and `println!` macros.
    * The `ops::{FnOnce, FnMut, Fn}` traits are now `#[stable]`. This is required to
      make bounds with these traits stable. Note that manual implementations of
      these traits are still gated by default, this stability only allows bounds
      such as `F: FnOnce()`.
    
    Additionally, the compiler now has special logic to ignore its own generated
    `__test` module for the `--test` harness in terms of stability.

    destructor checker (dropck).
    
    Largely adapted from pcwalton's original branch, with following
    notable modifications:
    
    Use `regionck::type_must_outlive` to generate `SafeDestructor`
    constraints.  (this plugged some soundness holes in the analysis).
    
    Avoid exponential time blowup on compile-fail/huge-struct.rs by
    keeping the breadcrumbs until end of traversal.
    
    Avoid premature return from regionck::visit_expr.
    
    Factored drop-checking code out into dropck module.
    
    Added `SafeDestructor` to enum `SubregionOrigin` (for error reporting).

    make `for PAT in ITER_EXPR { ... }` a terminating-scope for ITER_EXPR.
    
    In effect, temporary anonymous values created during the evaluation of ITER_EXPR no longer not live for the entirety of the block surrounding the for-loop; instead they only live for the extent of the for-loop itself, and no longer.
    
    ----
    
    There is one case I know of that this breaks, demonstrated to me by @nikomatsakis  (but it is also a corner-case that is useless in practice).  Here is that case:
    
    ```
    fn main() {
        let mut foo: Vec&lt;&amp;i8&gt; = Vec::new();
        for i in &amp;[1, 2, 3] { foo.push(i) }
    }
    ```
    
    Note that if you add any code following the for-loop above, or even a semicolon to the end of it, then the code will stop compiling (i.e., it gathers a vector of references but the gathered vector cannot actually be used.)
    
    (The above code, despite being useless, did occur in one run-pass test by accident; that test is updated here to accommodate the new striction.)

    Revised version of PR #21930.
    
    Restrictions on moves into and out-from fixed-length arrays.
    
    (There was only one use of this "feature" in the compiler source.)
    
    Note 1: the change to the error message in tests/compile-fail/borrowck-use-in-index-lvalue.rs, where we now report that *w is uninitialized (rather than w), was unintended fallout from the implementation strategy used here. The change appears harmless to me, but I welcome advice on how to bring back the old message, which was slightly cleaner (i.e. less unintelligible) since that the syntactic form *w does not actually appear in the source text.
    
    Note 2: the move out-from restriction to only apply to expr[i], and not destructuring bind (e.g. f([a, b, c]: Array) { ... }) since the latter is compatible with nonzeroing drop, AFAICT.

    Restrictions on moves out-from and into fixed-length arrays.
    
    No longer legal: `fn foo(a: [D; 5]) { drop(a); a[2] = D::new(); }`;
    one must first initialize the entirety of `a` before assigning to its
    individual elements.
    
    No longer legal: `fn foo(arr: [D; 5]) -&gt; D { arr[2] }`, unless `D`
    implements `Copy`. This "move out-from" restriction only affects
    `expr[i]`, and not destructuring (e.g. `f([a, b, c]: Array) { ... }`).
    
    uses mem_categorization to distinguish destructuring-bind from array
    indexing.

    Overloaded indexing (`&amp;[mut] foo[bar]`) only works when `&lt;Self as Index&gt;::Output` is the same as `&lt;Self as IndexMut&gt;::Output` (see issue above). To restrict implementations of `IndexMut` that doesn't work, this PR makes `IndexMut` a supertrait over `Index`, i.e. `trait IndexMut&lt;I&gt;: Index&lt;I&gt;`, just like in the `trait DerefMut: Deref` case.
    
    This breaks all downstream implementations of `IndexMut`, in most cases this simply means removing the `type Output = ..` bit, which is now redundant, from `IndexMut` implementations:
    
    ``` diff
     impl Index&lt;Foo&gt; for Bar {
         type Output = Baz;
         ..
     }
    
     impl IndexMut&lt;Foo&gt; for Bar {
    -    type Output = Baz;
         ..
     }
    ```

    In effect, temporary anonymous values created during the evaluation of
    ITER_EXPR no longer not live for the entirety of the block surrounding
    the for-loop; instead they only live for the extent of the for-loop

    fn main() {
        let mut foo: Vec&lt;&amp;i8&gt; = Vec::new();
        for i in &amp;[1, 2, 3] { foo.push(i) }
    }
    ```
    
    Note that if you add any code following the for-loop above, or even a
    semicolon to the end of it, then the code will stop compiling (i.e.,
    it gathers a vector of references but the gathered vector cannot
    actually be used.)
    
    (The above code, despite being useless, did occur in one run-pass test
    by accident; that test is updated here to accommodate the new
    striction.)

    This PR implements [path reform](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/474), and motivation and details for the change can be found there.
    
    For convenience, the old path API is being kept as `old_path` for the time being. Updating after this PR is just a matter of changing imports to `old_path` (which is likely not needed, since the prelude entries still export the old path API).
    
    This initial PR does not include additional normalization or platform-specific path extensions. These will be done in follow up commits or PRs.

    std: Remove `iter::ByRef` and generalize impls
    
    This removes the `ByRef` iterator adaptor to stay in line with the changes to
    `std::io`. The `by_ref` method instead just returns `&amp;mut Self`.
    
    This also removes the implementation of `Iterator for &amp;mut Iterator` and instead
    generalizes it to `Iterator for &amp;mut I` where `I: Iterator + ?Sized`. The
    `Box&lt;I&gt;` implementations were also updated.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the removal of the `std::iter::ByRef` type. All
    mentions of `ByRef&lt;'a, T&gt;` should be replaced with `&amp;mut T` to migrate forward.

    std: Add a new `env` module
    
    This is an implementation of [RFC 578][rfc] which adds a new `std::env` module
    to replace most of the functionality in the current `std::os` module. More
    details can be found in the RFC itself, but as a summary the following methods
    have all been deprecated:
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/578
    
    * `os::args_as_bytes`   =&gt; `env::args`
    * `os::args`            =&gt; `env::args`
    * `os::consts`          =&gt; `env::consts`
    * `os::dll_filename`    =&gt; no replacement, use `env::consts` directly
    * `os::page_size`       =&gt; `env::page_size`
    * `os::make_absolute`   =&gt; use `env::current_dir` + `join` instead
    * `os::getcwd`          =&gt; `env::current_dir`
    * `os::change_dir`      =&gt; `env::set_current_dir`
    * `os::homedir`         =&gt; `env::home_dir`
    * `os::tmpdir`          =&gt; `env::temp_dir`
    * `os::join_paths`      =&gt; `env::join_paths`
    * `os::split_paths`     =&gt; `env::split_paths`
    * `os::self_exe_name`   =&gt; `env::current_exe`
    * `os::self_exe_path`   =&gt; use `env::current_exe` + `pop`
    * `os::set_exit_status` =&gt; `env::set_exit_status`
    * `os::get_exit_status` =&gt; `env::get_exit_status`
    * `os::env`             =&gt; `env::vars`
    * `os::env_as_bytes`    =&gt; `env::vars`
    * `os::getenv`          =&gt; `env::var` or `env::var_string`
    * `os::getenv_as_bytes` =&gt; `env::var`
    * `os::setenv`          =&gt; `env::set_var`
    * `os::unsetenv`        =&gt; `env::remove_var`
    
    Many function signatures have also been tweaked for various purposes, but the
    main changes were:
    
    * `Vec`-returning APIs now all return iterators instead
    * All APIs are now centered around `OsString` instead of `Vec&lt;u8&gt;` or `String`.
      There is currently on convenience API, `env::var_string`, which can be used to
      get the value of an environment variable as a unicode `String`.
    
    All old APIs are `#[deprecated]` in-place and will remain for some time to allow
    for migrations. The semantics of the APIs have been tweaked slightly with regard
    to dealing with invalid unicode (panic instead of replacement).
    
    The new `std::env` module is all contained within the `env` feature, so crates
    must add the following to access the new APIs:
    
        #![feature(env)]

    rollup merge of #20790: japaric/for-loops
    
    As per [RFC #235][rfc], you can now do:
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0235-collections-conventions.md#intoiterator-and-iterable
    
    ``` rust
    let mut v = vec![1];
    
    // iterate over immutable references
    for x in &amp;v {
        assert_eq!(x, &amp;1);
    }
    
    // iterate over mutable references
    for x in &amp;mut v {
        assert_eq!(x, &amp;mut 1);
    }
    
    // iterate over values, this consumes `v`
    for x in v {
        assert_eq!(x, 1);
    }
    ```
    
    [breaking-change]s
    
    For loops now "consume" (move) the iterator, this breaks iterating over mutable references to iterators, and also breaks multiple iterations over the same iterator:
    
    ``` rust
    fn foo(mut it: &amp;mut Iter) {  // `Iter` implements `Iterator`
        for x in it { .. }  //~ error: `&amp;mut Iter` doesn't implement Iterator
    }
    
    fn bar() {
        for x in it { .. }  //~ note: `it` moved here
        for x in it { .. }  //~ error: `it` has been moved
    }
    ```
    
    Both cases can be fixed using the `by_ref()` adapter to create an iterator from the mutable reference:
    
    ``` rust
    fn foo(mut it: &amp;mut Iter) {
        for x in it.by_ref() { .. }
    }
    
    fn bar() {
        for x in it.by_ref() { .. }
        for x in it { .. }
    }
    ```
    
    This PR also makes iterator non-implicitly copyable, as this was source of subtle bugs in the libraries. You can still use `clone()` to explictly copy the iterator.
    
    Finally, since the for loops are implemented in the frontend and use global paths to `IntoIterator`, `Iterator` and `Option` variants, users of the `core` crate will have to use add an `std` module to the root of their crate to be able to use for loops:
    
    ``` rust
    #![no_std]
    
    extern crate core;
    
    fn main() {
        for x in 0..10 {}
    }
    
    #[doc(hidden)]
    mod std {
        // these imports are needed to use for-loops
        pub use core::iter;
        pub use core::option;
    }
    ```

    std: Stabilize the std::fmt module
    
    This commit performs a final stabilization pass over the std::fmt module,
    marking all necessary APIs as stable. One of the more interesting aspects of
    this module is that it exposes a good deal of its runtime representation to the
    outside world in order for `format_args!` to be able to construct the format
    strings. Instead of hacking the compiler to assume that these items are stable,
    this commit instead lays out a story for the stabilization and evolution of
    these APIs.
    
    There are three primary details used by the `format_args!` macro:
    
    1. `Arguments` - an opaque package of a "compiled format string". This structure
       is passed around and the `write` function is the source of truth for
       transforming a compiled format string into a string at runtime. This must be
       able to be constructed in stable code.
    
    2. `Argument` - an opaque structure representing an argument to a format string.
       This is *almost* a trait object as it's just a pointer/function pair, but due
       to the function originating from one of many traits, it's not actually a
       trait object. Like `Arguments`, this must be constructed from stable code.
    
    3. `fmt::rt` - this module contains the runtime type definitions primarily for
       the `rt::Argument` structure. Whenever an argument is formatted with
       nonstandard flags, a corresponding `rt::Argument` is generated describing how
       the argument is being formatted. This can be used to construct an
       `Arguments`.
    
    The primary interface to `std::fmt` is the `Arguments` structure, and as such
    this type name is stabilize as-is today. It is expected for libraries to pass
    around an `Arguments` structure to represent a pending formatted computation.
    
    The remaining portions are largely "cruft" which would rather not be stabilized,
    but due to the stability checks they must be. As a result, almost all pieces
    have been renamed to represent that they are "version 1" of the formatting
    representation. The theory is that at a later date if we change the
    representation of these types we can add new definitions called "version 2" and
    corresponding constructors for `Arguments`.
    
    One of the other remaining large questions about the fmt module were how the
    pending I/O reform would affect the signatures of methods in the module. Due to
    [RFC 526][rfc], however, the writers of fmt are now incompatible with the
    writers of io, so this question has largely been solved. As a result the
    interfaces are largely stabilized as-is today.
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0526-fmt-text-writer.md
    
    Specifically, the following changes were made:
    
    * The contents of `fmt::rt` were all moved under `fmt::rt::v1`
    * `fmt::rt` is stable
    * `fmt::rt::v1` is stable
    * `Error` is stable
    * `Writer` is stable
    * `Writer::write_str` is stable
    * `Writer::write_fmt` is stable
    * `Formatter` is stable
    * `Argument` has been renamed to `ArgumentV1` and is stable
    * `ArgumentV1::new` is stable
    * `ArgumentV1::from_uint` is stable
    * `Arguments::new_v1` is stable (renamed from `new`)
    * `Arguments::new_v1_formatted` is stable (renamed from `with_placeholders`)
    * All formatting traits are now stable, as well as the `fmt` method.
    * `fmt::write` is stable
    * `fmt::format` is stable
    * `Formatter::pad_integral` is stable
    * `Formatter::pad` is stable
    * `Formatter::write_str` is stable
    * `Formatter::write_fmt` is stable
    * Some assorted top level items which were only used by `format_args!` were
      removed in favor of static functions on `ArgumentV1` as well.
    * The formatting-flag-accessing methods remain unstable
    
    Within the contents of the `fmt::rt::v1` module, the following actions were
    taken:
    
    * Reexports of all enum variants were removed
    * All prefixes on enum variants were removed
    * A few miscellaneous enum variants were renamed
    * Otherwise all structs, fields, and variants were marked stable.
    
    In addition to these actions in the `std::fmt` module, many implementations of
    `Show` and `String` were stabilized as well.
    
    In some other modules:
    
    * `ToString` is now stable
    * `ToString::to_string` is now stable
    * `Vec` no longer implements `fmt::Writer` (this has moved to `String`)
    
    This is a breaking change due to all of the changes to the `fmt::rt` module, but
    this likely will not have much impact on existing programs.
