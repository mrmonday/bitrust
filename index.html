    Auto merge of #23430 - alexcrichton:io-error, r=aturon
    
    This commit stabilizes the `ErrorKind` enumeration which is consumed by and
    generated by the `io::Error` type. The purpose of this type is to serve as a
    cross-platform namespace to categorize errors into. Two specific issues are
    addressed as part of this stablization:
    
    * The naming of each variant was scrutinized and some were tweaked. An example
      is how `FileNotFound` was renamed to simply `NotFound`. These names should not
      show either a Unix or Windows bias and the set of names is intended to grow
      over time. For now the names will likely largely consist of those errors
      generated by the I/O APIs in the standard library.
    
    * The mapping of OS error codes onto kinds has been altered. Coalescing no
      longer occurs (multiple error codes become one kind). It is intended that each
      OS error code, if bound, corresponds to only one `ErrorKind`. The current set
      of error kinds was expanded slightly to include some networking errors.
    
    This commit also adds a `raw_os_error` function which returns an `Option&lt;i32&gt;`
    to extract the underlying raw error code from the `Error`.
    
    Closes #16666

    Rollup merge of #23475 - nikomatsakis:closure-ret-syntax, r=acrichto
    
     Require braces when a closure has an explicit return type. This is a [breaking-change]: instead of a closure like `|| -&gt; i32 22`, prefer `|| -&gt; i32 { 22 }`.
    
    Fixes #23420.

    Auto merge of #22838 - petrochenkov:bytelit, r=alexcrichton
    
    This patch changes the type of byte string literals from `&amp;[u8]` to `&amp;[u8; N]`.
    It also implements some necessary traits (`IntoBytes`, `Seek`, `Read`, `BufRead`) for fixed-size arrays (also related to #21725) and adds test for #17233, which seems to be resolved.
    
    Fixes #18465

    Auto merge of #23452 - nikomatsakis:unsafety-subtyping, r=nrc
    
    Safe fns are no longer subtypes of unsafe fns, but you can coerce from one to the other.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] in that impl fns must now be declared `unsafe` if the trait is declared `unsafe`. In some rare cases, the subtyping change may also direct affect you, but no such cases were encountered in practice.
    
    Fixes #23449.

    Auto merge of #23376 - eddyb:die-tydesc-die, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Final remnant of reflection is gone. Also, virtual `Trait` destructors are no longer tied to `Box`.
    That means they can be used to drop any instance of the type (used in libarena to replace TyDesc).
    
    This is [breaking-change] for direct users of intrinsics:
    * use `intrinsics::type_name::&lt;T&gt;()` instead of `(*intrinsics::get_tydesc::&lt;T&gt;()).name`
    * the only way to get the destructor is from a trait object's vtable (see libarena changes)

    Auto merge of #23423 - nikomatsakis:issue-18737-trait-subtyping, r=nrc
    
    This upcast coercion currently never requires vtable changes. It should be generalized.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] -- if you have an impl on an object type like `impl SomeTrait`, then this will no longer be applicable to object types like `SomeTrait+Send`. In the standard library, this primarily affected `Any`, and this PR adds impls for `Any+Send` as to keep the API the same in practice. An alternate workaround is to use UFCS form or standalone fns. For more details, see &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18737#issuecomment-78450798&gt;.

     To the correct MAP_NORESERVE. Every other instance is known as MAP_NORESERVE, so this is just a basic typo.
    
    I really doubt this will break anybody's but my own code.

    Auto merge of #23104 - japaric:inherent, r=nikomatsakis
    
    - Allow inherent implementations on `char`, `str`, `[T]`, `*const T`, `*mut T` and all the numeric primitives.
    - copy `unicode::char::CharExt` methods into `impl char`
    - remove `unicode::char::CharExt`, its re-export `std::char::CharExt` and `CharExt` from the prelude
    - copy `collections::str::StrExt` methods into `impl str`
    - remove `collections::str::StrExt` its re-export `std::str::StrExt`, and `StrExt` from the prelude
    - copy `collections::slice::SliceExt` methods into `impl&lt;T&gt; [T]`
    - remove `collections::slice::SliceExt` its re-export `std::slice::SliceExt`, and `SliceExt` from the prelude
    - copy `core::ptr::PtrExt` methods into `impl&lt;T&gt; *const T`
    - remove `core::ptr::PtrExt` its re-export `std::ptr::PtrExt`, and `PtrExt` from the prelude
    - copy `core::ptr::PtrExt` and `core::ptr::MutPtrExt` methods into `impl&lt;T&gt; *mut T`
    - remove `core::ptr::MutPtrExt` its re-export `std::ptr::MutPtrExt`, and `MutPtrExt` from the prelude
    - copy `core::num::Int` and `core::num::SignedInt` methods into `impl i{8,16,32,64,size}`
    - copy `core::num::Int` and `core::num::UnsignedInt` methods into `impl u{8,16,32,64,size}`
    - remove `core::num::UnsignedInt` and its re-export `std::num::UnsignedInt`
    - move `collections` tests into its own crate: `collectionstest`
    - copy `core::num::Float` methods into `impl f{32,64}`
    
    Because this PR removes several traits, this is a [breaking-change], however functionality remains unchanged and breakage due to unresolved imports should be minimal. If you encounter an error due to an unresolved import, simply remove the import:
    
    ``` diff
      fn main() {
    -     use std::num::UnsignedInt;  //~ error: unresolved import `std::num::UnsignedInt`.
    -
          println!("{}", 8_usize.is_power_of_two());
      }
    ```

    Auto merge of #23352 - alexcrichton:stabilize-net, r=aturon
    
    This commit performs a stabilization pass over the std::net module,
    incorporating the changes from RFC 923. Specifically, the following actions were
    taken:
    
    Stable functionality:
    
    * `net` (the name)
    * `Shutdown`
    * `Shutdown::{Read, Write, Both}`
    * `lookup_host`
    * `LookupHost`
    * `SocketAddr`
    * `SocketAddr::{V4, V6}`
    * `SocketAddr::port`
    * `SocketAddrV4`
    * `SocketAddrV4::{new, ip, port}`
    * `SocketAddrV6`
    * `SocketAddrV4::{new, ip, port, flowinfo, scope_id}`
    * Common trait impls for socket addr structures
    * `ToSocketAddrs`
    * `ToSocketAddrs::Iter`
    * `ToSocketAddrs::to_socket_addrs`
    * `ToSocketAddrs for {SocketAddr*, (Ipv*Addr, u16), str, (str, u16)}`
    * `Ipv4Addr`
    * `Ipv4Addr::{new, octets, to_ipv6_compatible, to_ipv6_mapped}`
    * `Ipv6Addr`
    * `Ipv6Addr::{new, segments, to_ipv4}`
    * `TcpStream`
    * `TcpStream::connect`
    * `TcpStream::{peer_addr, local_addr, shutdown, try_clone}`
    * `{Read,Write} for {TcpStream, &amp;TcpStream}`
    * `TcpListener`
    * `TcpListener::bind`
    * `TcpListener::{local_addr, try_clone, accept, incoming}`
    * `Incoming`
    * `UdpSocket`
    * `UdpSocket::bind`
    * `UdpSocket::{recv_from, send_to, local_addr, try_clone}`
    
    Unstable functionality:
    
    * Extra methods on `Ipv{4,6}Addr` for various methods of inspecting the address
      and determining qualities of it.
    * Extra methods on `TcpStream` to configure various protocol options.
    * Extra methods on `UdpSocket` to configure various protocol options.
    
    Deprecated functionality:
    
    * The `socket_addr` method has been renamed to `local_addr`
    
    This commit is a breaking change due to the restructuring of the `SocketAddr`
    type as well as the renaming of the `socket_addr` method. Migration should be
    fairly straightforward, however, after accounting for the new level of
    abstraction in `SocketAddr` (protocol distinction at the socket address level,
    not the IP address).

    Most of the changes are cleanup facilitated by straight-forward attribute handling.
    This is a minor [breaking-change] for users of `quote_stmt!` (returns `Option&lt;P&lt;Stmt&gt;&gt;` now) and some of the public methods in `Parser` (a few `Vec&lt;Attribute&gt;` arguments/returns were removed).

    This commit deprecates the `count`, `range` and `range_step` functions
    in `iter`, in favor of range notation. To recover all existing
    functionality, a new `step_by` adapter is provided directly on `ops::Range`
    and `ops::RangeFrom`.

    Auto merge of #23353 - alexcrichton:stabilize-os, r=aturon
    
    This commit starts to organize the `std::os::$platform` modules and in the
    process stabilizes some of the functionality contained within. The organization
    of these modules will reflect the organization of the standard library itself
    with extension traits for primitives in the same corresponding module.
    
    The OS-specific modules will grow more functionality over time including
    concrete types that are not extending functionality of other structures, and
    these will either go into the closest module in `std::os::$platform` or they
    will grow a new module in the hierarchy.
    
    The following items are now stable:
    
    * `os::{unix, windows}`
    * `unix::ffi`
    * `unix::ffi::OsStrExt`
    * `unix::ffi::OsStrExt::{from_bytes, as_bytes, to_cstring}`
    * `unix::ffi::OsString`
    * `unix::ffi::OsStringExt::{from_vec, into_vec}`
    * `unix::process`
    * `unix::process::CommandExt`
    * `unix::process::CommandExt::{uid, gid}`
    * `unix::process::ExitStatusExt`
    * `unix::process::ExitStatusExt::signal`

    Due to the reorgnization of the platform extension modules, this commit is a

    Auto merge of #23316 - alexcrichton:less-question-sized, r=aturon
    
    It is a frequent pattern among I/O functions to take `P: AsPath + ?Sized` or
    `AsOsStr` instead of `AsPath`. Most of these functions do not need to take
    ownership of their argument, but for libraries in general it's much more
    ergonomic to not deal with `?Sized` at all and simply require an argument `P`
    instead of `&amp;P`.
    
    This change is aimed at removing unsightly `?Sized` bounds while retaining the
    same level of usability as before. All affected functions now take ownership of
    their arguments instead of taking them by reference, but due to the forwarding
    implementations of `AsOsStr` and `AsPath` all code should continue to work as it
    did before.
    
    This is strictly speaking a breaking change due to the signatures of these
    functions changing, but normal idiomatic usage of these APIs should not break in
    practice.

    std: Stabilize the `net` module
    
    This commit performs a stabilization pass over the std::net module,
    incorporating the changes from RFC 923. Specifically, the following actions were
    taken:
    
    Stable functionality:
    
    * `net` (the name)
    * `Shutdown`
    * `Shutdown::{Read, Write, Both}`
    * `lookup_host`
    * `LookupHost`
    * `SocketAddr`
    * `SocketAddr::{V4, V6}`
    * `SocketAddr::port`
    * `SocketAddrV4`
    * `SocketAddrV4::{new, ip, port}`
    * `SocketAddrV6`
    * `SocketAddrV4::{new, ip, port, flowinfo, scope_id}`
    * Common trait impls for socket addr structures
    * `ToSocketAddrs`
    * `ToSocketAddrs::Iter`
    * `ToSocketAddrs::to_socket_addrs`
    * `ToSocketAddrs for {SocketAddr*, (Ipv*Addr, u16), str, (str, u16)}`
    * `Ipv4Addr`
    * `Ipv4Addr::{new, octets, to_ipv6_compatible, to_ipv6_mapped}`
    * `Ipv6Addr`
    * `Ipv6Addr::{new, segments, to_ipv4}`
    * `TcpStream`
    * `TcpStream::connect`
    * `TcpStream::{peer_addr, local_addr, shutdown, try_clone}`
    * `{Read,Write} for {TcpStream, &amp;TcpStream}`
    * `TcpListener`
    * `TcpListener::bind`
    * `TcpListener::{local_addr, try_clone, accept, incoming}`
    * `Incoming`
    * `UdpSocket`
    * `UdpSocket::bind`
    * `UdpSocket::{recv_from, send_to, local_addr, try_clone}`
    
    Unstable functionality:
    
    * Extra methods on `Ipv{4,6}Addr` for various methods of inspecting the address
      and determining qualities of it.
    * Extra methods on `TcpStream` to configure various protocol options.
    * Extra methods on `UdpSocket` to configure various protocol options.
    
    Deprecated functionality:
    
    * The `socket_addr` method has been renamed to `local_addr`
    
    This commit is a breaking change due to the restructuring of the `SocketAddr`
    type as well as the renaming of the `socket_addr` method. Migration should be
    fairly straightforward, however, after accounting for the new level of
    abstraction in `SocketAddr` (protocol distinction at the socket address level,
    not the IP address).

    Deprecate range, range_step, count, distributions
    
    This commit deprecates the `count`, `range` and `range_step` functions
    in `iter`, in favor of range notation. To recover all existing
    functionality, a new `step_by` adapter is provided directly on `ops::Range`
    and `ops::RangeFrom`.

    Auto merge of #23229 - aturon:stab-path, r=alexcrichton
    
    This commit stabilizes essentially all of the new `std::path` API. The
    API itself is changed in a couple of ways (which brings it in closer
    alignment with the RFC):
    
    * `.` components are now normalized away, unless they appear at the
      start of a path. This in turn effects the semantics of e.g. asking for
      the file name of `foo/` or `foo/.`, both of which yield `Some("foo")`
      now. This semantics is what the original RFC specified, and is also
      desirable given early experience rolling out the new API.
    
    * The `parent` method is now `without_file` and succeeds if, and only
      if, `file_name` is `Some(_)`. That means, in particular, that it fails
      for a path like `foo/../`. This change affects `pop` as well.
    
    In addition, the `old_path` module is now deprecated.

      well.
    
    * The `Prefix` component now involves a separate `PrefixComponent`
      struct, to better allow for keeping both parsed and unparsed prefix data.
    
    In addition, the `old_path` module is now deprecated.

    Auto merge of #23265 - eddyb:meth-ast-refactor, r=nikomatsakis
    
    The end result is that common fields (id, name, attributes, etc.) are stored in now-structures `ImplItem` and `TraitItem`.
    The signature of a method is no longer duplicated between methods with a body (default/impl) and those without, they now share `MethodSig`.
    
    This is also a [breaking-change] because of minor bugfixes and changes to syntax extensions:
    * `pub fn` methods in a trait no longer parse - remove the `pub`, it has no meaning anymore
    * `MacResult::make_methods` is now `make_impl_items` and the return type has changed accordingly
    * `quote_method` is gone, because `P&lt;ast::Method&gt;` doesn't exist and it couldn't represent a full method anyways - could be replaced by `quote_impl_item`/`quote_trait_item` in the future, but I do hope we realize how silly that combinatorial macro expansion is and settle on a single `quote` macro + some type hints - or just no types at all (only token-trees)
    
    r? @nikomatsakis This is necessary (hopefully also sufficient) for associated constants.

    This commit performs another pass over the `std::char` module for stabilization.
    Some minor cleanup is performed such as migrating documentation from libcore to
    libunicode (where the `std`-facing trait resides) as well as a slight
    reorganiation in libunicode itself. Otherwise, the stability modifications made
    are:
    
    * `char::from_digit` is now stable
    * `CharExt::is_digit` is now stable
    * `CharExt::to_digit` is now stable
    * `CharExt::to_{lower,upper}case` are now stable after being modified to return
      an iterator over characters. While the implementation today has not changed
      this should allow us to implement the full set of case conversions in unicode
      where some characters can map to multiple when doing an upper or lower case
      mapping.
    * `StrExt::to_{lower,upper}case` was added as unstable for a convenience of not
      having to worry about characters expanding to more characters when you just
      want the whole string to get into upper or lower case.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the change in the signatures of the
    `CharExt::to_{upper,lower}case` methods. Code can be updated to use functions
    like `flat_map` or `collect` to handle the difference.

    This is a hack, but I don't think we can do much better as long as `derive` is running at the syntax expansion phase.
    
    If the `custom_derive` feature gate is enabled, this works with user-defined traits and syntax extensions. Without the gate, you can't use e.g. `#[derive_Clone]` directly, so this does not change the stable language.
    
    To make this effective, we now check gated attributes both before and after macro expansion. This uncovered a number of tests that were missing feature gates.

    Auto merge of #22899 - huonw:macro-stability, r=alexcrichton
    
    Unstable items used in a macro expansion will now always trigger
    stability warnings, *unless* the unstable items are directly inside a
    macro marked with `#[allow_internal_unstable]`. IOW, the compiler warns
    unless the span of the unstable item is a subspan of the definition of a
    macro marked with that attribute.
    
    E.g.
    
        #[allow_internal_unstable]
        macro_rules! foo {
            ($e: expr) =&gt; {{
                $e;
                unstable(); // no warning
                only_called_by_foo!();
            }}
        }
    
        macro_rules! only_called_by_foo {
            () =&gt; { unstable() } // warning
        }
    
        foo!(unstable()) // warning
    
    The unstable inside `foo` is fine, due to the attribute. But the
    `unstable` inside `only_called_by_foo` is not, since that macro doesn't
    have the attribute, and the `unstable` passed into `foo` is also not
    fine since it isn't contained in the macro itself (that is, even though
    it is only used directly in the macro).
    
    In the process this makes the stability tracking much more precise,
    e.g. previously `println!("{}", unstable())` got no warning, but now it
    does. As such, this is a bug fix that may cause [breaking-change]s.
    
    The attribute is definitely feature gated, since it explicitly allows
    side-stepping the feature gating system.
    
    ---
    
    This updates `thread_local!` macro to use the attribute, since it uses
    unstable features internally (initialising a struct with unstable
    fields).

    Rollup merge of #23081 - alexcrichton:stabilize-fs, r=aturon
    
     This commit performs a stabilization pass over the `std::fs` module now that
    it's had some time to bake. The change was largely just adding `#[stable]` tags,
    but there are a few APIs that remain `#[unstable]`.
    
    The following apis are now marked `#[stable]`:
    
    * `std::fs` (the name)
    * `File`
    * `Metadata`
    * `ReadDir`
    * `DirEntry`
    * `OpenOptions`
    * `Permissions`
    * `File::{open, create}`
    * `File::{sync_all, sync_data}`
    * `File::set_len`
    * `File::metadata`
    * Trait implementations for `File` and `&amp;File`
    * `OpenOptions::new`
    * `OpenOptions::{read, write, append, truncate, create}`
    * `OpenOptions::open` - this function was modified, however, to not attempt to
      reject cross-platform openings of directories. This means that some platforms
      will succeed in opening a directory and others will fail.
    * `Metadata::{is_dir, is_file, len, permissions}`
    * `Permissions::{readonly, set_readonly}`
    * `Iterator for ReadDir`
    * `DirEntry::path`
    * `remove_file` - like with `OpenOptions::open`, the extra windows code to
      remove a readonly file has been removed. This means that removing a readonly
      file will succeed on some platforms but fail on others.
    * `metadata`
    * `rename`
    * `copy`
    * `hard_link`
    * `soft_link`
    * `read_link`
    * `create_dir`
    * `create_dir_all`
    * `remove_dir`
    * `remove_dir_all`
    * `read_dir`
    
    The following apis remain `#[unstable]`.
    
    * `WalkDir` and `walk` - there are many methods by which a directory walk can be
      constructed, and it's unclear whether the current semantics are the right
      ones. For example symlinks are not handled super well currently. This is now
      behind a new `fs_walk` feature.
    * `File::path` - this is an extra abstraction which the standard library
      provides on top of what the system offers and it's unclear whether we should
      be doing so. This is now behind a new `file_path` feature.
    * `Metadata::{accessed, modified}` - we do not currently have a good
      abstraction for a moment in time which is what these APIs should likely be
      returning, so these remain `#[unstable]` for now. These are now behind a new
      `fs_time` feature
    * `set_file_times` - like with `Metadata::accessed`, we do not currently have
      the appropriate abstraction for the arguments here so this API remains
      unstable behind the `fs_time` feature gate.
    * `PathExt` - the precise set of methods on this trait may change over time and
      some methods may be removed. This API remains unstable behind the `path_ext`
      feature gate.
    * `set_permissions` - we may wish to expose a more granular ability to set the
      permissions on a file instead of just a blanket \"set all permissions\" method.
      This function remains behind the `fs` feature.
    
    The following apis are now `#[deprecated]`
    
    * The `TempDir` type is now entirely deprecated and is [located on
      crates.io][tempdir] as the `tempdir` crate with [its source][github] at
      rust-lang/tempdir.

    The stability of some of these APIs has been questioned over the past few weeks
    in using these APIs, and it is intentional that the majority of APIs here are
    marked `#[stable]`. The `std::fs` module has a lot of room to grow and the

     The new `io` module has had some time to bake and this commit stabilizes some of

    `std::old_io::util` functions and structures.

    * Delegating implementations of I/O traits for references and `Box` pointers
    * Implementations of I/O traits for primitives like slices and `Vec&lt;T&gt;`
    * `ReadExt::bytes`

    These items remain `#[unstable]`
    
    * Core I/O traits. These may want a little bit more time to bake along with the

    * `BufReadExt::split` - this function may be renamed to not conflict with
      `SliceExt::split`.
    * `Error` - there are a number of questions about its representation,
      `ErrorKind`, and usability.
    
    These items are now `#[deprecated]` in `old_io`

    Rollup merge of #22980 - alexcrichton:debug-assertions, r=pnkfelix
    
     This commit is an implementation of [RFC 563][rfc] which adds a new
    `cfg(debug_assertions)` directive which is specially recognized and calculated
    by the compiler. The flag is turned off at any optimization level greater than 1
    and may also be explicitly controlled through the `-C debug-assertions`
    flag.
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/563
    
    The `debug_assert!` and `debug_assert_eq!` macros now respect this instead of
    the `ndebug` variable and `ndebug` no longer holds any meaning to the standard
    library.
    
    Code which was previously relying on `not(ndebug)` to gate expensive code should
    be updated to rely on `debug_assertions` instead.

    Auto merge of #23026 - nikomatsakis:issue-20220-supertrait, r=nikomatsakis
    
    The main gist of this PR is commit 1077efb which removes the list of supertraits from the `TraitDef` and pulls them into a separate table, which is accessed via `lookup_super_predicates`. This is analogous to `lookup_predicates`, which gets the complete where clause. This allows us to create the `TraitDef`, which contains the list generics and so forth, without fully knowing the list of supertraits. This in turn allows the *supertrait listing* to contain references to associated types like `&lt;Self as Foo&gt;::Item`, which were previously impossible because conversion required having the `TraitDef` for `Foo`.
    
    We do not yet support `Self::Item` in a supertrait listing. This doesn't work because to convert that, it attempts to expand out the full set of supertraits, which are in the process of being created. This could potentially be worked out by having the expansion of supertraits proceed in a lazy fashion, but we'd have to define shadowing rules for associated types which we don't currently have.
    
    Along the way (in 9de9ec5) I also removed the restriction against duplicate bounds and generalized the code so that it can handle having the same supertrait multiple times with different arguments, e.g. `Foo : Bar&lt;i32&gt; + Bar&lt;u32&gt;`. This restriction was serving no particular purpose, since the same trait could be extended multiple times indirectly, and in the era of multidispatch it is actively harmful.
    
    This is technically a [breaking-change] because it affects the definition of a super-trait. Anything in a where clause that looks like `where Self : Foo` is now considered a supertrait. Because cycles are disallowed in supertraits, that could lead to some errors. This has not been observed in any existing code.

    Add #[allow_internal_unstable] to track stability for macros better.
    
    Unstable items used in a macro expansion will now always trigger
    stability warnings, *unless* the unstable items are directly inside a
    macro marked with `#[allow_internal_unstable]`. IOW, the compiler warns
    unless the span of the unstable item is a subspan of the definition of a
    macro marked with that attribute.
    
    E.g.
    
        #[allow_internal_unstable]
        macro_rules! foo {
            ($e: expr) =&gt; {{
                $e;
                unstable(); // no warning
                only_called_by_foo!();
            }}
        }
    
        macro_rules! only_called_by_foo {
            () =&gt; { unstable() } // warning
        }
    
        foo!(unstable()) // warning
    
    The unstable inside `foo` is fine, due to the attribute. But the
    `unstable` inside `only_called_by_foo` is not, since that macro doesn't
    have the attribute, and the `unstable` passed into `foo` is also not
    fine since it isn't contained in the macro itself (that is, even though
    it is only used directly in the macro).
    
    In the process this makes the stability tracking much more precise,
    e.g. previously `println!("{}", unstable())` got no warning, but now it
    does. As such, this is a bug fix that may cause [breaking-change]s.
    
    The attribute is definitely feature gated, since it explicitly allows
    side-stepping the feature gating system.

    Auto merge of #22873 - alexcrichton:deprecate-fs, r=aturon
    
    This commit deprecates the majority of std::old_io::fs in favor of std::fs and
    its new functionality. Some functions remain non-deprecated but are now behind a
    feature gate called `old_fs`. These functions will be deprecated once
    suitable replacements have been implemented.
    
    The compiler has been migrated to new `std::fs` and `std::path` APIs where
    appropriate as part of this change.

    std: Stabilize portions of the `io` module
    
    The new `io` module has had some time to bake and this commit stabilizes some of
    the utilities associated with it. This commit also deprecates a number of
    `std::old_io::util` functions and structures.
    
    These items are now `#[stable]`
    
    * `Cursor`
    * `Cursor::{new, into_inner, get_ref, get_mut, position, set_position}`
    * Implementations of I/O traits for `Cursor&lt;T&gt;`
    * Delegating implementations of I/O traits for references and `Box` pointers
    * Implementations of I/O traits for primitives like slices and `Vec&lt;T&gt;`
    * `ReadExt::bytes`
    * `Bytes` (and impls)
    * `ReadExt::chain`
    * `Chain` (and impls)
    * `ReadExt::take` (and impls)
    * `BufReadExt::lines`
    * `Lines` (and impls)
    * `io::copy`
    * `io::{empty, Empty}` (and impls)
    * `io::{sink, Sink}` (and impls)
    * `io::{repeat, Repeat}` (and impls)
    
    These items remain `#[unstable]`
    
    * Core I/O traits. These may want a little bit more time to bake along with the
      commonly used methods like `read_to_end`.
    * `BufReadExt::split` - this function may be renamed to not conflict with
      `SliceExt::split`.
    * `Error` - there are a number of questions about its representation,
      `ErrorKind`, and usability.
    
    These items are now `#[deprecated]` in `old_io`
    
    * `LimitReader` - use `take` instead
    * `NullWriter` - use `io::sink` instead
    * `ZeroReader` - use `io::repeat` instead
    * `NullReader` - use `io::empty` instead
    * `MultiWriter` - use `broadcast` instead
    * `ChainedReader` - use `chain` instead
    * `TeeReader` - use `tee` instead
    * `copy` - use `io::copy` instead

    * Replaced a few instances of `InvariantType&lt;T&gt;` with

    * Disabled the `deprecated` lint in several places that
      reference/implement traits on deprecated items which will get cleaned
      up in the future
    * Unfortunately, this means that if a library declares
      `#![deny(deprecated)]` and marks anything as deprecated, it will have
      to disable the lint for any uses of said item, e.g. any impl the now
      deprecated item
    
    For any library that denies deprecated items but has deprecated items
    of its own, this is a [breaking-change]
    
    I had originally intended for the lint to ignore uses of deprecated items that are declared in the same crate, but this goes against some previous test cases that expect the lint to capture *all* uses of deprecated items, so I maintained the previous approach to avoid changing the expected behavior of the lint.
    
    Tested locally on OS X, so hopefully there aren't any deprecated item uses behind a `cfg` that I may have missed.

    rustc: implement arithmetic overflow checking
    
    Adds overflow checking to integer addition, multiplication, and subtraction
    when `-Z force-overflow-checks` is true, or if `--cfg ndebug` is not passed to
    the compiler. On overflow, it panics with `arithmetic operation overflowed`.
    Also adds `overflowing_add`, `overflowing_sub`, and `overflowing_mul`
    intrinsics for doing unchecked arithmetic.

    std: Stabilize the `process` module
    
    This commits blanket marks the API of the `std::process` module as `#[stable]`.
    The module's API is very similar to the old `std::old_io::process` API and has
    generally had quite a bit of time to bake both before and after the new module
    landed.
    
    The one modification made to the API is that `Stdio::capture` is now named
    `stdio::piped`.

    Replace MacExpr / MacPat / MacItems with MacEager
    
    MacEager is a MacResult implementation for the common case where you've already
    built each form of AST that you might return.
    
    Fixes #17637. Based on #18814.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] for syntax extensions:
    
      * MacExpr::new becomes MacEager::expr.
    
      * MacPat::new becomes MacEager::pat.
    
      * MacItems::new becomes MacEager::items. It takes a SmallVector directly,
        not an iterator.

    Rollup merge of #22817 - jmesmon:result-or-type, r=huonw
    
     Changes .or() so that it can return a Result with a different E type
    than the one it is called on.
    
    Essentially:
    
        fn or(self, res: Result&lt;T, E&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;T, E&gt;
    
    becomes
    
        fn or&lt;F&gt;(self, res: Result&lt;T, F&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;T, F&gt;
    
    This brings `or` in line with the existing `and` &amp; `or_else`
    
    This is a
    [breaking-change]
    Due to some code needing additional type annotations.

    Auto merge of #22172 - eddyb:almost-there, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Adds `&lt;module::Type&gt;::method` support and makes `module::Type::method` a shorthand for it.
    This is most of #16293, except that chaining multiple associated types is not yet supported.
    It also fixes #22563 as `impl`s are no longer treated as modules in resolve.
    
    Unfortunately, this is still a *[breaking-change]*:
    * If you used a global path to a primitive type, i.e. `::bool`, `::i32` etc. - that was a bug I had to fix.
    Solution: remove the leading `::`.
    * If you passed explicit `impl`-side type parameters to an inherent method, e.g.:
    ```rust
    struct Foo&lt;T&gt;(T);
    impl&lt;A, B&gt; Foo&lt;(A, B)&gt; {
        fn pair(a: A, b: B) -&gt; Foo&lt;(A, B)&gt; { Foo((a, b)) }
    }
    Foo::&lt;A, B&gt;::pair(a, b)
    // Now that is sugar for:
    &lt;Foo&lt;A, B&gt;&gt;::pair(a, b)
    // Which isn't valid because `Foo` has only one type parameter.
    // Solution: replace with:
    Foo::&lt;(A, B)&gt;::pair(a, b)
    // And, if possible, remove the explicit type param entirely:
    Foo::pair(a, b)
    ```
    * If you used the `QPath`-related `AstBuilder` methods @hugwijst added in #21943.
    The methods still exist, but `QPath` was replaced by `QSelf`, with the actual path stored separately.
    Solution: unpack the pair returned by `cx.qpath` to get the two arguments for `cx.expr_qpath`.

    Stabilize std::borrow
    
    This commit stabilizes `std::borrow`, making the following modifications
    to catch up the API with language changes:
    
    * It renames `BorrowFrom` to `Borrow`, as was originally intended (but
      blocked for technical reasons), and reorders the parameters
      accordingly.
    
    * It moves the type parameter of `ToOwned` to an associated type. This
      is somewhat less flexible, in that each borrowed type must have a
      unique owned type, but leads to a significant simplification for
      `Cow`. Flexibility can be regained by using newtyped slices, which is
      advisable for other reasons anyway.
    
    * It removes the owned type parameter from `Cow`, making the type much
      less verbose.
    
    * Deprecates the `is_owned` and `is_borrowed` predicates in favor of
      direct matching.
    
    The above API changes are relatively minor; the basic functionality
    remains the same, and essentially the whole module is now marked
    `#[stable]`.

    rollup merge of #22482: alexcrichton/cstr-changes
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 592][r592] and [RFC 840][r840]. These
    two RFCs tweak the behavior of `CString` and add a new `CStr` unsized slice type
    to the module.
    
    [r592]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0592-c-str-deref.md
    [r840]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0840-no-panic-in-c-string.md
    
    The new `CStr` type is only constructable via two methods:
    
    1. By `deref`'ing from a `CString`
    2. Unsafely via `CStr::from_ptr`
    
    The purpose of `CStr` is to be an unsized type which is a thin pointer to a
    `libc::c_char` (currently it is a fat pointer slice due to implementation
    limitations). Strings from C can be safely represented with a `CStr` and an
    appropriate lifetime as well. Consumers of `&amp;CString` should now consume `&amp;CStr`
    instead to allow producers to pass in C-originating strings instead of just
    Rust-allocated strings.
    
    A new constructor was added to `CString`, `new`, which takes `T: IntoBytes`
    instead of separate `from_slice` and `from_vec` methods (both have been
    deprecated in favor of `new`). The `new` method returns a `Result` instead of
    panicking.  The error variant contains the relevant information about where the
    error happened and bytes (if present). Conversions are provided to the
    `io::Error` and `old_io::IoError` types via the `FromError` trait which
    translate to `InvalidInput`.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the modification of existing `#[unstable]` APIs
    and new deprecation, and more detailed information can be found in the two RFCs.
    Notable breakage includes:
    
    * All construction of `CString` now needs to use `new` and handle the outgoing
      `Result`.
    * Usage of `CString` as a byte slice now explicitly needs a `.as_bytes()` call.
    * The `as_slice*` methods have been removed in favor of just having the
      `as_bytes*` methods.

    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 823][rfc] which is another pass over
    the `std::hash` module for stabilization. The contents of the module were not
    entirely marked stable, but some portions which remained quite similar to the
    previous incarnation are now marked `#[stable]`. Specifically:
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0823-hash-simplification.md
    
    * `std::hash` is now stable (the name)
    * `Hash` is now stable
    * `Hash::hash` is now stable
    * `Hasher` is now stable
    * `SipHasher` is now stable
    * `SipHasher::new` and `new_with_keys` are now stable
    * `Hasher for SipHasher` is now stable
    * Many `Hash` implementations are now stable
    
    All other portions of the `hash` module remain `#[unstable]` as they are less
    commonly used and were recently redesigned.

    * Usage of `CString` as a byte slice now explicitly needs a `.as_bytes()` call.
    * The `as_slice*` methods have been removed in favor of just having the
      `as_bytes*` methods.

    make FromIterator use IntoIterator
    
    This breaks all implementors of FromIterator, as they must now accept IntoIterator instead of Iterator. The fix for this is generally trivial (change the bound, and maybe call into_iter() on the argument to get the old argument).
    
    Users of FromIterator should be unaffected because Iterators are IntoIterator.

    std: Stabilize the `hash` module
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 823][rfc] which is another pass over
    the `std::hash` module for stabilization. The contents of the module were not
    entirely marked stable, but some portions which remained quite similar to the
    previous incarnation are now marked `#[stable]`. Specifically:
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0823-hash-simplification.md
    
    * `std::hash` is now stable (the name)
    * `Hash` is now stable
    * `Hash::hash` is now stable
    * `Hasher` is now stable
    * `SipHasher` is now stable
    * `SipHasher::new` and `new_with_keys` are now stable
    * `Hasher for SipHasher` is now stable
    * Many `Hash` implementations are now stable
    
    All other portions of the `hash` module remain `#[unstable]` as they are less
    commonly used and were recently redesigned.
    
    This commit is a breaking change due to the modifications to the `std::hash` API
    and more details can be found on the [RFC][rfc].

    * Move the type parameter on the `AsciiExt` trait to an associated type named
      `Owned`.
    * Move `ascii::escape_default` to using an iterator.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the removal of the type parameter on the
    `AsciiExt` trait as well as the modifications to the `escape_default` function
    to returning an iterator. Manual implementations of `AsciiExt` (or `AsciiExt`
    bounds) should be adjusted to remove the type parameter and using the new
    `escape_default` should be relatively straightforward.

    Revise std::thread semantics
    
    This commit makes several changes to `std::thread` in preparation for
    final stabilization:
    
    * It removes the ability to handle panics from `scoped` children; see
      #20807 for discussion
    
    * It adds a `JoinHandle` structure, now returned from `spawn`, which
      makes it possible to join on children that do not share data from
      their parent's stack. The child is automatically detached when the
      handle is dropped, and the handle cannot be copied due to Posix
      semantics.
    
    * It moves all static methods from `std::thread::Thread` to free
      functions in `std::thread`. This was done in part because, due to the
      above changes, there are effectively no direct `Thread` constructors,
      and the static methods have tended to feel a bit awkward.
    
    * Adds an `io::Result` around the `Builder` methods `scoped` and
      `spawn`, making it possible to handle OS errors when creating
      threads. The convenience free functions entail an unwrap.
    
    * Stabilizes the entire module. Despite the fact that the API is
      changing somewhat here, this is part of a long period of baking and
      the changes are addressing all known issues prior to alpha2. If
      absolutely necessary, further breaking changes can be made prior to beta.

    std: Stabilize the `ascii` module
    
    This commit performs a stabilization pass over the `std::ascii` module taking
    the following actions:
    
    * the module name is now stable
    * `AsciiExt` is now stable after moving its type parameter to an `Owned`
      associated type
    * `AsciiExt::is_ascii` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::to_ascii_uppercase` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::to_ascii_lowercase` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::eq_ignore_ascii_case` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::make_ascii_uppercase` is added to possibly replace
      `OwnedAsciiExt::into_ascii_uppercase` (similarly for lowercase variants).
    * `escape_default` now returns an iterator and is stable
    * `EscapeDefault` is now stable
    
    Trait implementations are now also marked stable.
    
    Primarily it is still unstable to *implement* the `AsciiExt` trait due to it
    containing some unstable methods.

    Rollup merge of #22313 - japaric:iter, r=aturon
    
     `IntoIterator` now has an extra associated item:
    
    ``` rust
    trait IntoIterator {
        type Item;
        type IntoIter: Iterator&lt;Self=Self::Item&gt;;
    }
    ```
    
    This lets you bind the iterator \"`Item`\" directly when writing generic functions:
    
    ``` rust
    // hypothetical change, not included in this PR
    impl Extend&lt;T&gt; for Vec&lt;T&gt; {
        // you can now write
        fn extend&lt;I&gt;(&amp;mut self, it: I) where I: IntoIterator&lt;Item=T&gt; { .. }
        // instead of
        fn extend&lt;I: IntoIterator&gt;(&amp;mut self, it: I) where I::IntoIter: Iterator&lt;Item=T&gt; { .. }
    }
    ```
    
    The downside is that now you have to write an extra associated type in your `IntoIterator` implementations:
    
    ``` diff
     impl&lt;T&gt; IntoIterator for Vec&lt;T&gt; {
    +    type Item = T;
         type IntoIter = IntoIter&lt;T&gt;;
    
         fn into_iter(self) -&gt; IntoIter&lt;T&gt; { .. }
     }
    ```
    
    Because this breaks all downstream implementations of `IntoIterator`, this is a [breaking-change]

    Fix fallout in libsyntax from RFC 599. Clarity and efficiency seems to be mostly improved, to my eye.
    Nonetheless, as this commit demonstrates, the previous commits was a [breaking-change].
    
    In practice, breakage is focused on functions of this form:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo(..., object: Box&lt;FnMut()&gt;)
    ````
    
    where `FnMut()` could be any trait object type. The older scheme defaulted objects in argument
    position so that they were bounded by a fresh lifetime:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(..., object: Box&lt;FnMut()+'a&gt;)
    ```
    
    This meant that the object could contain borrowed data. The newer
    scheme defaults to a lifetime bound of `'static`:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo(..., object: Box&lt;FnMut()+'static&gt;)
    ```
    
    This means that the object cannot contain borrowed data. In some cases, the best fix
    is to stop using `Box`:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo(..., object: &amp;mut FnMut())
    ```
    
    but another option is to write an explicit annotation for the `'a`
    lifetime that used to be implicit.  Both fixes are demonstrated in
    this commit.
