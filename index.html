    Auto merge of #23126 - alexcrichton:char-third-pass, r=aturon
    
    This commit performs another pass over the `std::char` module for stabilization.
    Some minor cleanup is performed such as migrating documentation from libcore to
    libunicode (where the `std`-facing trait resides) as well as a slight
    reorganiation in libunicode itself. Otherwise, the stability modifications made
    are:
    
    * `char::from_digit` is now stable
    * `CharExt::is_digit` is now stable
    * `CharExt::to_digit` is now stable
    * `CharExt::to_{lower,upper}case` are now stable after being modified to return
      an iterator over characters. While the implementation today has not changed
      this should allow us to implement the full set of case conversions in unicode
      where some characters can map to multiple when doing an upper or lower case
      mapping.
    * `StrExt::to_{lower,upper}case` was added as unstable for a convenience of not
      having to worry about characters expanding to more characters when you just
      want the whole string to get into upper or lower case.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the change in the signatures of the
    `CharExt::to_{upper,lower}case` methods. Code can be updated to use functions
    like `flat_map` or `collect` to handle the difference.

    Auto merge of #23137 - kmcallister:derive-sugar, r=sfackler
    
    This is a hack, but I don't think we can do much better as long as `derive` is running at the syntax expansion phase.
    
    If the `custom_derive` feature gate is enabled, this works with user-defined traits and syntax extensions. Without the gate, you can't use e.g. `#[derive_Clone]` directly, so this does not change the stable language.
    
    To make this effective, we now check gated attributes both before and after macro expansion. This uncovered a number of tests that were missing feature gates.
    
    This PR also cleans up the deriving code somewhat, and forbids some previously-meaningless attribute syntax. For this reason it's technically a

    rollup merge of #22813: alexcrichton/deprecate-net
    
    The `std::net` primitives should be ready for use now and as a result the old
    ones are now deprecated and slated for removal. Most TCP/UDP functionality is
    now available through `std::net` but the `std::old_io::net::pipe` module is
    removed entirely from the standard library.
    
    Unix socket funtionality can be found in sfackler's [`unix_socket`][unix] crate
    and there is currently no replacement for named pipes on Windows.

    Auto merge of #22899 - huonw:macro-stability, r=alexcrichton
    
    Unstable items used in a macro expansion will now always trigger
    stability warnings, *unless* the unstable items are directly inside a
    macro marked with `#[allow_internal_unstable]`. IOW, the compiler warns
    unless the span of the unstable item is a subspan of the definition of a
    macro marked with that attribute.
    
    E.g.
    
        #[allow_internal_unstable]
        macro_rules! foo {
            ($e: expr) =&gt; {{
                $e;
                unstable(); // no warning
                only_called_by_foo!();
            }}
        }
    
        macro_rules! only_called_by_foo {
            () =&gt; { unstable() } // warning
        }
    
        foo!(unstable()) // warning
    
    The unstable inside `foo` is fine, due to the attribute. But the
    `unstable` inside `only_called_by_foo` is not, since that macro doesn't
    have the attribute, and the `unstable` passed into `foo` is also not
    fine since it isn't contained in the macro itself (that is, even though
    it is only used directly in the macro).
    
    In the process this makes the stability tracking much more precise,
    e.g. previously `println!("{}", unstable())` got no warning, but now it
    does. As such, this is a bug fix that may cause [breaking-change]s.
    
    The attribute is definitely feature gated, since it explicitly allows
    side-stepping the feature gating system.
    
    ---
    
    This updates `thread_local!` macro to use the attribute, since it uses
    unstable features internally (initialising a struct with unstable
    fields).

    Rollup merge of #23081 - alexcrichton:stabilize-fs, r=aturon
    
     This commit performs a stabilization pass over the `std::fs` module now that
    it's had some time to bake. The change was largely just adding `#[stable]` tags,
    but there are a few APIs that remain `#[unstable]`.
    
    The following apis are now marked `#[stable]`:
    
    * `std::fs` (the name)
    * `File`
    * `Metadata`
    * `ReadDir`
    * `DirEntry`
    * `OpenOptions`
    * `Permissions`
    * `File::{open, create}`
    * `File::{sync_all, sync_data}`
    * `File::set_len`
    * `File::metadata`
    * Trait implementations for `File` and `&amp;File`
    * `OpenOptions::new`
    * `OpenOptions::{read, write, append, truncate, create}`
    * `OpenOptions::open` - this function was modified, however, to not attempt to
      reject cross-platform openings of directories. This means that some platforms
      will succeed in opening a directory and others will fail.
    * `Metadata::{is_dir, is_file, len, permissions}`
    * `Permissions::{readonly, set_readonly}`
    * `Iterator for ReadDir`
    * `DirEntry::path`
    * `remove_file` - like with `OpenOptions::open`, the extra windows code to
      remove a readonly file has been removed. This means that removing a readonly
      file will succeed on some platforms but fail on others.
    * `metadata`
    * `rename`
    * `copy`
    * `hard_link`
    * `soft_link`
    * `read_link`
    * `create_dir`
    * `create_dir_all`
    * `remove_dir`
    * `remove_dir_all`
    * `read_dir`
    
    The following apis remain `#[unstable]`.
    
    * `WalkDir` and `walk` - there are many methods by which a directory walk can be
      constructed, and it's unclear whether the current semantics are the right
      ones. For example symlinks are not handled super well currently. This is now
      behind a new `fs_walk` feature.
    * `File::path` - this is an extra abstraction which the standard library
      provides on top of what the system offers and it's unclear whether we should
      be doing so. This is now behind a new `file_path` feature.
    * `Metadata::{accessed, modified}` - we do not currently have a good
      abstraction for a moment in time which is what these APIs should likely be
      returning, so these remain `#[unstable]` for now. These are now behind a new
      `fs_time` feature
    * `set_file_times` - like with `Metadata::accessed`, we do not currently have
      the appropriate abstraction for the arguments here so this API remains
      unstable behind the `fs_time` feature gate.
    * `PathExt` - the precise set of methods on this trait may change over time and
      some methods may be removed. This API remains unstable behind the `path_ext`
      feature gate.
    * `set_permissions` - we may wish to expose a more granular ability to set the
      permissions on a file instead of just a blanket \"set all permissions\" method.
      This function remains behind the `fs` feature.
    
    The following apis are now `#[deprecated]`
    
    * The `TempDir` type is now entirely deprecated and is [located on
      crates.io][tempdir] as the `tempdir` crate with [its source][github] at
      rust-lang/tempdir.
    
    [tempdir]: https://crates.io/crates/tempdir
    [github]: https://github.com/rust-lang/tempdir
    
    The stability of some of these APIs has been questioned over the past few weeks
    in using these APIs, and it is intentional that the majority of APIs here are
    marked `#[stable]`. The `std::fs` module has a lot of room to grow and the
    material is [being tracked in a RFC issue][rfc-issue].

     This module is now superseded by the `std::process` module. This module still

    Rollup merge of #23010 - alexcrichton:deprecate-some-old-io, r=aturon
    
     The new `io` module has had some time to bake and this commit stabilizes some of
    the utilities associated with it. This commit also deprecates a number of
    `std::old_io::util` functions and structures.
    
    These items are now `#[stable]`
    
    * `Cursor`
    * `Cursor::{new, into_inner, get_ref, get_mut, position, set_position}`
    * Implementations of I/O traits for `Cursor&lt;T&gt;`
    * Delegating implementations of I/O traits for references and `Box` pointers
    * Implementations of I/O traits for primitives like slices and `Vec&lt;T&gt;`
    * `ReadExt::bytes`
    * `Bytes` (and impls)
    * `ReadExt::chain`
    * `Chain` (and impls)
    * `ReadExt::take` (and impls)
    * `BufReadExt::lines`
    * `Lines` (and impls)
    * `io::copy`
    * `io::{empty, Empty}` (and impls)
    * `io::{sink, Sink}` (and impls)
    * `io::{repeat, Repeat}` (and impls)
    
    These items remain `#[unstable]`
    
    * Core I/O traits. These may want a little bit more time to bake along with the
      commonly used methods like `read_to_end`.
    * `BufReadExt::split` - this function may be renamed to not conflict with
      `SliceExt::split`.
    * `Error` - there are a number of questions about its representation,
      `ErrorKind`, and usability.
    
    These items are now `#[deprecated]` in `old_io`
    
    * `LimitReader` - use `take` instead
    * `NullWriter` - use `io::sink` instead
    * `ZeroReader` - use `io::repeat` instead
    * `NullReader` - use `io::empty` instead
    * `MultiWriter` - use `broadcast` instead
    * `ChainedReader` - use `chain` instead
    * `TeeReader` - use `tee` instead
    * `copy` - use `io::copy` instead

    Rollup merge of #22980 - alexcrichton:debug-assertions, r=pnkfelix
    
     This commit is an implementation of [RFC 563][rfc] which adds a new
    `cfg(debug_assertions)` directive which is specially recognized and calculated
    by the compiler. The flag is turned off at any optimization level greater than 1
    and may also be explicitly controlled through the `-C debug-assertions`
    flag.
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/563
    
    The `debug_assert!` and `debug_assert_eq!` macros now respect this instead of
    the `ndebug` variable and `ndebug` no longer holds any meaning to the standard
    library.
    
    Code which was previously relying on `not(ndebug)` to gate expensive code should
    be updated to rely on `debug_assertions` instead.

    unless the span of the unstable item is a subspan of the definition of a

    The following apis remain `#[unstable]`.
    
    * `WalkDir` and `walk` - there are many methods by which a directory walk can be
      constructed, and it's unclear whether the current semantics are the right
      ones. For example symlinks are not handled super well currently. This is now
      behind a new `fs_walk` feature.
    * `File::path` - this is an extra abstraction which the standard library
      provides on top of what the system offers and it's unclear whether we should
      be doing so. This is now behind a new `file_path` feature.
    * `Metadata::{accessed, modified}` - we do not currently have a good
      abstraction for a moment in time which is what these APIs should likely be
      returning, so these remain `#[unstable]` for now. These are now behind a new
      `fs_time` feature
    * `set_file_times` - like with `Metadata::accessed`, we do not currently have
      the appropriate abstraction for the arguments here so this API remains
      unstable behind the `fs_time` feature gate.
    * `PathExt` - the precise set of methods on this trait may change over time and
      some methods may be removed. This API remains unstable behind the `path_ext`
      feature gate.
    * `set_permissions` - we may wish to expose a more granular ability to set the
      permissions on a file instead of just a blanket "set all permissions" method.
      This function remains behind the `fs` feature.
    
    The following apis are now `#[deprecated]`
    
    * The `TempDir` type is now entirely deprecated and is [located on
      crates.io][tempdir] as the `tempdir` crate with [its source][github] at
      rust-lang/tempdir.

    [github]: https://github.com/rust-lang/tempdir
    
    The stability of some of these APIs has been questioned over the past few weeks
    in using these APIs, and it is intentional that the majority of APIs here are
    marked `#[stable]`. The `std::fs` module has a lot of room to grow and the
    material is [being tracked in a RFC issue][rfc-issue].

    rustc: Add a debug_assertions #[cfg] directive
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 563][rfc] which adds a new
    `cfg(debug_assertions)` directive which is specially recognized and calculated
    by the compiler. The flag is turned off at any optimization level greater than 1
    and may also be explicitly controlled through the `-C debug-assertions`
    flag.
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/563
    
    The `debug_assert!` and `debug_assert_eq!` macros now respect this instead of
    the `ndebug` variable and `ndebug` no longer holds any meaning to the standard
    library.
    
    Code which was previously relying on `not(ndebug)` to gate expensive code should
    be updated to rely on `debug_assertions` instead.
    
    Closes #22492

    Auto merge of #23026 - nikomatsakis:issue-20220-supertrait, r=nikomatsakis
    
    The main gist of this PR is commit 1077efb which removes the list of supertraits from the `TraitDef` and pulls them into a separate table, which is accessed via `lookup_super_predicates`. This is analogous to `lookup_predicates`, which gets the complete where clause. This allows us to create the `TraitDef`, which contains the list generics and so forth, without fully knowing the list of supertraits. This in turn allows the *supertrait listing* to contain references to associated types like `&lt;Self as Foo&gt;::Item`, which were previously impossible because conversion required having the `TraitDef` for `Foo`.
    
    We do not yet support `Self::Item` in a supertrait listing. This doesn't work because to convert that, it attempts to expand out the full set of supertraits, which are in the process of being created. This could potentially be worked out by having the expansion of supertraits proceed in a lazy fashion, but we'd have to define shadowing rules for associated types which we don't currently have.
    
    Along the way (in 9de9ec5) I also removed the restriction against duplicate bounds and generalized the code so that it can handle having the same supertrait multiple times with different arguments, e.g. `Foo : Bar&lt;i32&gt; + Bar&lt;u32&gt;`. This restriction was serving no particular purpose, since the same trait could be extended multiple times indirectly, and in the era of multidispatch it is actively harmful.
    
    This is technically a [breaking-change] because it affects the definition of a super-trait. Anything in a where clause that looks like `where Self : Foo` is now considered a supertrait. Because cycles are disallowed in supertraits, that could lead to some errors. This has not been observed in any existing code.

    Add #[allow_internal_unstable] to track stability for macros better.
    
    Unstable items used in a macro expansion will now always trigger
    stability warnings, *unless* the unstable items are directly inside a
    macro marked with `#[allow_internal_unstable]`. IOW, the compiler warns
    unless the span of the unstable item is a subspan of the definition of a
    macro marked with that attribute.
    
    E.g.
    
        #[allow_internal_unstable]
        macro_rules! foo {
            ($e: expr) =&gt; {{
                $e;
                unstable(); // no warning
                only_called_by_foo!();
            }}
        }
    
        macro_rules! only_called_by_foo {
            () =&gt; { unstable() } // warning
        }
    
        foo!(unstable()) // warning
    
    The unstable inside `foo` is fine, due to the attribute. But the
    `unstable` inside `only_called_by_foo` is not, since that macro doesn't
    have the attribute, and the `unstable` passed into `foo` is also not
    fine since it isn't contained in the macro itself (that is, even though
    it is only used directly in the macro).
    
    In the process this makes the stability tracking much more precise,
    e.g. previously `println!("{}", unstable())` got no warning, but now it
    does. As such, this is a bug fix that may cause [breaking-change]s.
    
    The attribute is definitely feature gated, since it explicitly allows
    side-stepping the feature gating system.

    This commit deprecates the majority of std::old_io::fs in favor of std::fs and
    its new functionality. Some functions remain non-deprecated but are now behind a
    feature gate called `old_fs`. These functions will be deprecated once
    suitable replacements have been implemented.
    
    The compiler has been migrated to new `std::fs` and `std::path` APIs where

    std: Stabilize portions of the `io` module
    
    The new `io` module has had some time to bake and this commit stabilizes some of
    the utilities associated with it. This commit also deprecates a number of
    `std::old_io::util` functions and structures.
    
    These items are now `#[stable]`
    
    * `Cursor`
    * `Cursor::{new, into_inner, get_ref, get_mut, position, set_position}`
    * Implementations of I/O traits for `Cursor&lt;T&gt;`
    * Delegating implementations of I/O traits for references and `Box` pointers
    * Implementations of I/O traits for primitives like slices and `Vec&lt;T&gt;`
    * `ReadExt::bytes`
    * `Bytes` (and impls)
    * `ReadExt::chain`
    * `Chain` (and impls)
    * `ReadExt::take` (and impls)
    * `BufReadExt::lines`
    * `Lines` (and impls)
    * `io::copy`
    * `io::{empty, Empty}` (and impls)
    * `io::{sink, Sink}` (and impls)
    * `io::{repeat, Repeat}` (and impls)
    
    These items remain `#[unstable]`
    
    * Core I/O traits. These may want a little bit more time to bake along with the
      commonly used methods like `read_to_end`.
    * `BufReadExt::split` - this function may be renamed to not conflict with
      `SliceExt::split`.
    * `Error` - there are a number of questions about its representation,
      `ErrorKind`, and usability.
    
    These items are now `#[deprecated]` in `old_io`
    
    * `LimitReader` - use `take` instead
    * `NullWriter` - use `io::sink` instead
    * `ZeroReader` - use `io::repeat` instead
    * `NullReader` - use `io::empty` instead
    * `MultiWriter` - use `broadcast` instead

    I had originally intended for the lint to ignore uses of deprecated items that are declared in the same crate, but this goes against some previous test cases that expect the lint to capture *all* uses of deprecated items, so I maintained the previous approach to avoid changing the expected behavior of the lint.
    
    Tested locally on OS X, so hopefully there aren't any deprecated item uses behind a `cfg` that I may have missed.

    std: Stabilize the `process` module
    
    This commits blanket marks the API of the `std::process` module as `#[stable]`.
    The module's API is very similar to the old `std::old_io::process` API and has
    generally had quite a bit of time to bake both before and after the new module
    landed.
    
    The one modification made to the API is that `Stdio::capture` is now named
    `stdio::piped`.

    Rename LintPass::check_trait_method to check_trait_item
    
    Traits can have associated types and not just methods. This
    clarification reflects the the type of the input the method accepts.

    Error out when using static_assert on a non-boolean value
    
    static_assert is documented as working on static with type `bool`, but
    we currently accept it on any const static and crash when the const has
    an non-integral type.
    
    This is a breaking-change for anyone who used static_assert on types
    likes i32, which happened to work but seems like an unintended
    consequence of the missing error checking.

    Rollup merge of #22875 - kmcallister:maceager, r=sfackler
    
     MacEager is a MacResult implementation for the common case where you've already built each form of AST that you might return.
    
    Fixes #17637. Based on #18814.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] for syntax extensions:
    
      * MacExpr::new becomes MacEager::expr.
    
      * MacPat::new becomes MacEager::pat.
    
      * MacItems::new becomes MacEager::items. It takes a SmallVector directly,
        not an iterator.

    Auto merge of #22801 - huonw:crateify-lint, r=kmcallister
    
    This pulls out the implementations of most built-in lints into a
    separate crate, to reduce edit-compile-test iteration times with
    librustc_lint and increase parallelism. This should enable lints to be
    refactored, added and deleted much more easily as it slashes the
    edit-compile cycle to get a minimal working compiler to test with (`make
    rustc-stage1`) from
    
        librustc -&gt; librustc_typeck -&gt; ... -&gt; librustc_driver -&gt;

    which is significantly faster, mainly due to avoiding the librustc build
    itself.
    
    The intention would be to move as much as possible of the infrastructure
    into the crate too, but the plumbing is deeply intertwined with librustc
    itself at the moment. Also, there are lints for which diagnostics are
    registered directly in the compiler code, not in their own crate
    traversal, and their definitions have to remain in librustc.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] for direct users of the compiler APIs:
    callers of `rustc::session::build_session` or
    `rustc::session::build_session_` need to manually call
    `rustc_lint::register_builtins` on their return value.

    Auto merge of #22172 - eddyb:almost-there, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Adds `&lt;module::Type&gt;::method` support and makes `module::Type::method` a shorthand for it.
    This is most of #16293, except that chaining multiple associated types is not yet supported.
    It also fixes #22563 as `impl`s are no longer treated as modules in resolve.
    
    Unfortunately, this is still a *[breaking-change]*:
    * If you used a global path to a primitive type, i.e. `::bool`, `::i32` etc. - that was a bug I had to fix.
    Solution: remove the leading `::`.
    * If you passed explicit `impl`-side type parameters to an inherent method, e.g.:
    ```rust
    struct Foo&lt;T&gt;(T);
    impl&lt;A, B&gt; Foo&lt;(A, B)&gt; {
        fn pair(a: A, b: B) -&gt; Foo&lt;(A, B)&gt; { Foo((a, b)) }
    }
    Foo::&lt;A, B&gt;::pair(a, b)
    // Now that is sugar for:
    &lt;Foo&lt;A, B&gt;&gt;::pair(a, b)
    // Which isn't valid because `Foo` has only one type parameter.
    // Solution: replace with:
    Foo::&lt;(A, B)&gt;::pair(a, b)
    // And, if possible, remove the explicit type param entirely:
    Foo::pair(a, b)
    ```
    * If you used the `QPath`-related `AstBuilder` methods @hugwijst added in #21943.
    The methods still exist, but `QPath` was replaced by `QSelf`, with the actual path stored separately.
    Solution: unpack the pair returned by `cx.qpath` to get the two arguments for `cx.expr_qpath`.

    Stabilize std::borrow
    
    This commit stabilizes `std::borrow`, making the following modifications
    to catch up the API with language changes:
    
    * It renames `BorrowFrom` to `Borrow`, as was originally intended (but
      blocked for technical reasons), and reorders the parameters
      accordingly.
    
    * It moves the type parameter of `ToOwned` to an associated type. This
      is somewhat less flexible, in that each borrowed type must have a
      unique owned type, but leads to a significant simplification for
      `Cow`. Flexibility can be regained by using newtyped slices, which is
      advisable for other reasons anyway.
    
    * It removes the owned type parameter from `Cow`, making the type much
      less verbose.
    
    * Deprecates the `is_owned` and `is_borrowed` predicates in favor of
      direct matching.
    
    The above API changes are relatively minor; the basic functionality
    remains the same, and essentially the whole module is now marked
    `#[stable]`.

    rollup merge of #22482: alexcrichton/cstr-changes
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 592][r592] and [RFC 840][r840]. These
    two RFCs tweak the behavior of `CString` and add a new `CStr` unsized slice type
    to the module.
    
    [r592]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0592-c-str-deref.md
    [r840]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0840-no-panic-in-c-string.md
    
    The new `CStr` type is only constructable via two methods:
    
    1. By `deref`'ing from a `CString`
    2. Unsafely via `CStr::from_ptr`
    
    The purpose of `CStr` is to be an unsized type which is a thin pointer to a
    `libc::c_char` (currently it is a fat pointer slice due to implementation
    limitations). Strings from C can be safely represented with a `CStr` and an
    appropriate lifetime as well. Consumers of `&amp;CString` should now consume `&amp;CStr`
    instead to allow producers to pass in C-originating strings instead of just
    Rust-allocated strings.
    
    A new constructor was added to `CString`, `new`, which takes `T: IntoBytes`
    instead of separate `from_slice` and `from_vec` methods (both have been
    deprecated in favor of `new`). The `new` method returns a `Result` instead of
    panicking.  The error variant contains the relevant information about where the
    error happened and bytes (if present). Conversions are provided to the
    `io::Error` and `old_io::IoError` types via the `FromError` trait which
    translate to `InvalidInput`.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the modification of existing `#[unstable]` APIs
    and new deprecation, and more detailed information can be found in the two RFCs.
    Notable breakage includes:
    
    * All construction of `CString` now needs to use `new` and handle the outgoing
      `Result`.
    * Usage of `CString` as a byte slice now explicitly needs a `.as_bytes()` call.
    * The `as_slice*` methods have been removed in favor of just having the
      `as_bytes*` methods.

    * `Hasher for SipHasher` is now stable

    make FromIterator use IntoIterator
    
    This breaks all implementors of FromIterator, as they must now accept IntoIterator instead of Iterator. The fix for this is generally trivial (change the bound, and maybe call into_iter() on the argument to get the old argument).
    
    Users of FromIterator should be unaffected because Iterators are IntoIterator.

    * Move the type parameter on the `AsciiExt` trait to an associated type named
      `Owned`.
    * Move `ascii::escape_default` to using an iterator.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the removal of the type parameter on the
    `AsciiExt` trait as well as the modifications to the `escape_default` function
    to returning an iterator. Manual implementations of `AsciiExt` (or `AsciiExt`
    bounds) should be adjusted to remove the type parameter and using the new
    `escape_default` should be relatively straightforward.

    Revise std::thread semantics
    
    This commit makes several changes to `std::thread` in preparation for
    final stabilization:
    
    * It removes the ability to handle panics from `scoped` children; see
      #20807 for discussion
    
    * It adds a `JoinHandle` structure, now returned from `spawn`, which
      makes it possible to join on children that do not share data from
      their parent's stack. The child is automatically detached when the
      handle is dropped, and the handle cannot be copied due to Posix
      semantics.
    
    * It moves all static methods from `std::thread::Thread` to free
      functions in `std::thread`. This was done in part because, due to the
      above changes, there are effectively no direct `Thread` constructors,
      and the static methods have tended to feel a bit awkward.
    
    * Adds an `io::Result` around the `Builder` methods `scoped` and
      `spawn`, making it possible to handle OS errors when creating
      threads. The convenience free functions entail an unwrap.
    
    * Stabilizes the entire module. Despite the fact that the API is
      changing somewhat here, this is part of a long period of baking and
      the changes are addressing all known issues prior to alpha2. If
      absolutely necessary, further breaking changes can be made prior to beta.

    std: Stabilize the `ascii` module
    
    This commit performs a stabilization pass over the `std::ascii` module taking
    the following actions:
    
    * the module name is now stable
    * `AsciiExt` is now stable after moving its type parameter to an `Owned`
      associated type
    * `AsciiExt::is_ascii` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::to_ascii_uppercase` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::to_ascii_lowercase` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::eq_ignore_ascii_case` is now stable
    * `AsciiExt::make_ascii_uppercase` is added to possibly replace
      `OwnedAsciiExt::into_ascii_uppercase` (similarly for lowercase variants).
    * `escape_default` now returns an iterator and is stable
    * `EscapeDefault` is now stable
    
    Trait implementations are now also marked stable.
    
    Primarily it is still unstable to *implement* the `AsciiExt` trait due to it
    containing some unstable methods.

    Rollup merge of #22313 - japaric:iter, r=aturon
    
     `IntoIterator` now has an extra associated item:
    
    ``` rust
    trait IntoIterator {
        type Item;
        type IntoIter: Iterator&lt;Self=Self::Item&gt;;
    }
    ```
    
    This lets you bind the iterator \"`Item`\" directly when writing generic functions:
    
    ``` rust
    // hypothetical change, not included in this PR
    impl Extend&lt;T&gt; for Vec&lt;T&gt; {
        // you can now write
        fn extend&lt;I&gt;(&amp;mut self, it: I) where I: IntoIterator&lt;Item=T&gt; { .. }
        // instead of
        fn extend&lt;I: IntoIterator&gt;(&amp;mut self, it: I) where I::IntoIter: Iterator&lt;Item=T&gt; { .. }
    }
    ```
    
    The downside is that now you have to write an extra associated type in your `IntoIterator` implementations:

    Deprecate std::sync::TaskPool
    
    Rather than stabilize on the current API, we're going to punt this
    concern to crates.io, to allow for faster iteration.

    Expose more of std::path
    
    This commit exposes the `is_sep` function and `MAIN_SEP` constant, as
    well as Windows path prefixes. The path prefix enum is safely exposed on
    all platforms, but it only yielded as a component for Windows.
    
    Exposing the prefix enum as part of prefix components involved changing
    the type from `OsStr` to the `Prefix` enum, which is a:

    Fix fallout in libsyntax from RFC 599. Clarity and efficiency seems to be mostly improved, to my eye.
    Nonetheless, as this commit demonstrates, the previous commits was a [breaking-change].
    
    In practice, breakage is focused on functions of this form:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo(..., object: Box&lt;FnMut()&gt;)
    ````
    
    where `FnMut()` could be any trait object type. The older scheme defaulted objects in argument
    position so that they were bounded by a fresh lifetime:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(..., object: Box&lt;FnMut()+'a&gt;)
    ```
    
    This meant that the object could contain borrowed data. The newer
    scheme defaults to a lifetime bound of `'static`:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo(..., object: Box&lt;FnMut()+'static&gt;)
    ```
    
    This means that the object cannot contain borrowed data. In some cases, the best fix
    is to stop using `Box`:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo(..., object: &amp;mut FnMut())
    ```
    
    but another option is to write an explicit annotation for the `'a`
    lifetime that used to be implicit.  Both fixes are demonstrated in
    this commit.

    Rollup merge of #22299 - bluss:range-64-is-not-exact-size, r=alexcrichton
    
     Fixes #22047
    
    `Range&lt;u64&gt;` and `Range&lt;i64&gt;` may be longer than usize::MAX on 32-bit
    platforms, and thus they cannot fulfill the protocol for
    ExactSizeIterator. We don't want a nonobvious platform dependency in
    basic iterator traits, so the trait impl is removed.
    
    The logic of this change assumes that usize is at least 32-bit.
    
    This is technically a breaking change; note that `Range&lt;usize&gt;` and
    `Range&lt;isize&gt;` are always ExactSizeIterators.

    rustc: Fix a number of stability lint holes
    
    There are a number of holes that the stability lint did not previously cover,
    including:
    
    * Types
    * Bounds on type parameters on functions and impls
    * Where clauses
    * Imports
    * Patterns (structs and enums)
    
    These holes have all been fixed by overriding the `visit_path` function on the
    AST visitor instead of a few specialized cases. This change also necessitated a
    few stability changes:
    
    * The `collections::fmt` module is now stable (it was already supposed to be).
    * The `thread_local::imp::Key` type is now stable (it was already supposed to
      be).
    * The `std::rt::{begin_unwind, begin_unwind_fmt}` functions are now stable.
      These are required via the `panic!` macro.
    * The `std::old_io::stdio::{println, println_args}` functions are now stable.
      These are required by the `print!` and `println!` macros.
    * The `ops::{FnOnce, FnMut, Fn}` traits are now `#[stable]`. This is required to
      make bounds with these traits stable. Note that manual implementations of
      these traits are still gated by default, this stability only allows bounds
      such as `F: FnOnce()`.
    
    Additionally, the compiler now has special logic to ignore its own generated
    `__test` module for the `--test` harness in terms of stability.

    Add `box_patterns` feature gate.
    
    Switch feature-gate checker from `box_syntax` to `box_patterns` when
    visiting a pattern.
    
    (Having to opt into both `box_syntax` and `box_patterns` seemed
    unnecessary.)

    destructor checker (dropck).
    
    Largely adapted from pcwalton's original branch, with following
    notable modifications:
    
    Use `regionck::type_must_outlive` to generate `SafeDestructor`
    constraints.  (this plugged some soundness holes in the analysis).
    
    Avoid exponential time blowup on compile-fail/huge-struct.rs by
    keeping the breadcrumbs until end of traversal.
    
    Avoid premature return from regionck::visit_expr.
    
    Factored drop-checking code out into dropck module.
    
    Added `SafeDestructor` to enum `SubregionOrigin` (for error reporting).
    
    ----
    
    Since this imposes restrictions on the lifetimes used in types with
    destructors, this is a (wait for it)

    Auto merge of #22026 - kmcallister:plugin, r=sfackler
    
    ```rust
    #[plugin] #[no_link] extern crate bleh;
    ```
    
    becomes a crate attribute
    
    ```rust
    #![plugin(bleh)]
    ```
    
    The feature gate is still required.
    
    It's almost never correct to link a plugin into the resulting library / executable, because it will bring all of libsyntax and librustc with it. However if you really want this behavior, you can get it with a separate `extern crate` item in addition to the `plugin` attribute.
    
    Fixes #21043.
    Fixes #20769.

    std: Rename IntoIterator::Iter to IntoIter
    
    This is in preparation for stabilization of the `IntoIterator` trait. All
    implementations and references to `Iter` need to be renamed to `IntoIter`.
