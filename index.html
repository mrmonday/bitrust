    Deprecate slicing methods in favor of notation
    
    This commit deprecates `slice`, `slice_from`, `slice_to` and their
    mutable variants in favor of slice notation.
    
    The `as_slice` methods are left intact, for now.

    Stabilize Index traits and most range notation
    
    This commit marks as `#[stable]`:
    
    * The `Index` and `IndexMut` traits. These are stabilized as taking the
      index itself *by reference*; after extensive discussion it was
      determined that this is a better match with our choices
      elsewhere (e.g. making comparison operators auto-reference), and that
      the use cases for by-value indices are better handled through
      `IndexSet`.
    
    * The `Range`, `RangeFrom` and `RangeTo` structs, introduced for range
      notation.
    
    * Various impls of `Index` and `IndexMut`.
    
    The `FullRange` struct is left unstable as we may wish to rename it to
    `RangeFull` in the future.
    
    This commit also *removes* the `Step` trait in favor of direct
    implementation of iterator traits on ranges for integers. The `Step`
    trait was not a terribly useful factoring internally, and it is likely
    that external integer types are best off implementing range iterators
    directly. It was removed to simplify the API surface. We can always
    reintroduce `Step` later if it turns out to be useful.
    
    Due to this removal, this is a:

    std: Rename Show/String to Debug/Display
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 565][rfc] which is a stabilization of
    the `std::fmt` module and the implementations of various formatting traits.
    Specifically, the following changes were performed:
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0565-show-string-guidelines.md
    
    * The `Show` trait is now deprecated, it was renamed to `Debug`
    * The `String` trait is now deprecated, it was renamed to `Display`
    * Many `Debug` and `Display` implementations were audited in accordance with the
      RFC and audited implementations now have the `#[stable]` attribute
      * Integers and floats no longer print a suffix
      * Smart pointers no longer print details that they are a smart pointer
      * Paths with `Debug` are now quoted and escape characters
    * The `unwrap` methods on `Result` now require `Display` instead of `Debug`
    * The `Error` trait no longer has a `detail` method and now requires that
      `Display` must be implemented. With the loss of `String`, this has moved into
      libcore.
    * `impl&lt;E: Error&gt; FromError&lt;E&gt; for Box&lt;Error&gt;` now exists
    * `derive(Show)` has been renamed to `derive(Debug)`. This is not currently
      warned about due to warnings being emitted on stage1+
    
    While backwards compatibility is attempted to be maintained with a blanket
    implementation of `Display` for the old `String` trait (and the same for
    `Show`/`Debug`) this is still a breaking change due to primitives no longer
    implementing `String` as well as modifications such as `unwrap` and the `Error`
    trait. Most code is fairly straightforward to update with a rename or tweaks of
    method calls.

    Rollup merge of #21312 - michaelsproul:remove-error-send-bound, r=aturon
    
    As discussed with @aturon, this PR removes the `Send` bound from `std::error::Error`, allowing us to implement `Error` for error types containing non-`Send` types. Current examples include `PoisonError` and `TryLockError` from `std::sync` which contain a Guard that we don't want sent between tasks.

    it always succeeded.

    std: Move the bitflags! macro to a gated crate
    
    In accordance with [collections reform part 2][rfc] this macro has been moved to
    an external [bitflags crate][crate] which is [available though
    crates.io][cratesio]. Inside the standard distribution the macro has been moved
    to a crate called `rustc_bitflags` for current users to continue using.
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0509-collections-reform-part-2.md
    [crate]: https://github.com/rust-lang/bitflags
    [cratesio]: http://crates.io/crates/bitflags
    
    The major user of `bitflags!` in terms of a public-facing possibly-stable API
    today is the `FilePermissions` structure inside of `std::io`. This user,
    however, will likely no longer use `bitflags!` after I/O reform has landed. To
    prevent breaking APIs today, this structure remains as-is.
    
    Current users of the `bitflags!` macro should add this to their `Cargo.toml`:
    
        bitflags = "0.1"
    
    and this to their crate root:
    
        #[macro_use] extern crate bitflags;

    rustc: Fix a leak in dependency= paths
    
    With the addition of separate search paths to the compiler, it was intended that
    applications such as Cargo could require a `--extern` flag per `extern crate`
    directive in the source. The system can currently be subverted, however, due to
    the `existing_match()` logic in the crate loader.
    
    When loading crates we first attempt to match an `extern crate` directive
    against all previously loaded crates to avoid reading metadata twice. This "hit
    the cache if possible" step was erroneously leaking crates across the search
    path boundaries, however. For example:
    
        extern crate b;
        extern crate a;
    
    If `b` depends on `a`, then it will load crate `a` when the `extern crate b`
    directive is being processed. When the compiler reaches `extern crate a` it will
    use the previously loaded version no matter what. If the compiler was not
    invoked with `-L crate=path/to/a`, it will still succeed.
    
    This behavior is allowing `extern crate` declarations in Cargo without a
    corresponding declaration in the manifest of a dependency, which is considered
    a bug.
    
    This commit fixes this problem by keeping track of the origin search path for a
    crate. Crates loaded from the dependency search path are not candidates for
    crates which are loaded from the crate search path.
    
    As a result of this fix, this is a likely a breaking change for a number of
    Cargo packages. If the compiler starts informing that a crate can no longer be
    found, it likely means that the dependency was forgotten in your Cargo.toml.

    This PR adds rules for negative implementations. It follows pretty much what the [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0019-opt-in-builtin-traits.md) says with 1 main difference:
    
    Instead of positive implementations override negative implementations, this have been implemented in a way that a negative implementation of `Trait` for `T` will overlap with a positive implementation, causing a coherence error.

    rollup merge of #20654: alexcrichton/stabilize-hash
    
    This commit aims to prepare the `std::hash` module for alpha by formalizing its
    current interface whileholding off on adding `#[stable]` to the new APIs.  The
    current usage with the `HashMap` and `HashSet` types is also reconciled by
    separating out composable parts of the design. The primary goal of this slight
    redesign is to separate the concepts of a hasher's state from a hashing
    algorithm itself.
    
    The primary change of this commit is to separate the `Hasher` trait into a
    `Hasher` and a `HashState` trait. Conceptually the old `Hasher` trait was
    actually just a factory for various states, but hashing had very little control
    over how these states were used. Additionally the old `Hasher` trait was
    actually fairly unrelated to hashing.
    
    This commit redesigns the existing `Hasher` trait to match what the notion of a
    `Hasher` normally implies with the following definition:
    
        trait Hasher {
            type Output;
            fn reset(&amp;mut self);
            fn finish(&amp;self) -&gt; Output;
        }
    
    This `Hasher` trait emphasizes that hashing algorithms may produce outputs other
    than a `u64`, so the output type is made generic. Other than that, however, very
    little is assumed about a particular hasher. It is left up to implementors to
    provide specific methods or trait implementations to feed data into a hasher.
    
    The corresponding `Hash` trait becomes:
    
        trait Hash&lt;H: Hasher&gt; {
            fn hash(&amp;self, &amp;mut H);
        }
    
    The old default of `SipState` was removed from this trait as it's not something
    that we're willing to stabilize until the end of time, but the type parameter is
    always required to implement `Hasher`. Note that the type parameter `H` remains
    on the trait to enable multidispatch for specialization of hashing for
    particular hashers.
    
    Note that `Writer` is not mentioned in either of `Hash` or `Hasher`, it is
    simply used as part `derive` and the implementations for all primitive types.
    
    With these definitions, the old `Hasher` trait is realized as a new `HashState`
    trait in the `collections::hash_state` module as an unstable addition for
    now. The current definition looks like:
    
        trait HashState {
            type Hasher: Hasher;
            fn hasher(&amp;self) -&gt; Hasher;
        }
    
    The purpose of this trait is to emphasize that the one piece of functionality
    for implementors is that new instances of `Hasher` can be created.  This
    conceptually represents the two keys from which more instances of a
    `SipHasher` can be created, and a `HashState` is what's stored in a
    `HashMap`, not a `Hasher`.
    
    Implementors of custom hash algorithms should implement the `Hasher` trait, and
    only hash algorithms intended for use in hash maps need to implement or worry
    about the `HashState` trait.
    
    The entire module and `HashState` infrastructure remains `#[unstable]` due to it
    being recently redesigned, but some other stability decision made for the
    `std::hash` module are:
    
    * The `Writer` trait remains `#[experimental]` as it's intended to be replaced
      with an `io::Writer` (more details soon).
    * The top-level `hash` function is `#[unstable]` as it is intended to be generic
      over the hashing algorithm instead of hardwired to `SipHasher`
    * The inner `sip` module is now private as its one export, `SipHasher` is
      reexported in the `hash` module.
    
    And finally, a few changes were made to the default parameters on `HashMap`.
    
    * The `RandomSipHasher` default type parameter was renamed to `RandomState`.
      This renaming emphasizes that it is not a hasher, but rather just state to
      generate hashers. It also moves away from the name "sip" as it may not always
      be implemented as `SipHasher`. This type lives in the
      `std::collections::hash_map` module as `#[unstable]`
    
    * The associated `Hasher` type of `RandomState` is creatively called...
      `Hasher`! This concrete structure lives next to `RandomState` as an
      implemenation of the "default hashing algorithm" used for a `HashMap`. Under
      the hood this is currently implemented as `SipHasher`, but it draws an
      explicit interface for now and allows us to modify the implementation over
      time if necessary.

    std: Stablize the macros module
    
    This commit performs a pass over the `std::macros` module, applying stability
    attributes where necessary. In particular, this audits macros for patterns such
    as:
    
    * Standard use of forward-to-format-args via `$($arg:tt)*` (or `+`)
    * Prevent macro-defined identifiers from leaking into expression arguments as
      hygiene is not perfectly implemented.
    * Wherever possible, `$crate` is used now.
    
    Specifically, the following actions were taken:
    
    * The `std::macros` module itself is no longer public.
    * The `panic!` macro is stable
    * The `assert!` macro is stable
    * The `assert_eq!` macro is stable
    * The `debug_assert!` macro is stable
    * The `debug_assert_eq!` macro is stable
    * The `unreachable!` macro is stable after removing the extra forms to bring the
      definition in line with the `unimplemented!` macro.
    * The `try!` macro is stable
    * The `vec!` macro is stable

    std: Stabilize the std::hash module
    
    This commit aims to prepare the `std::hash` module for alpha by formalizing its
    current interface whileholding off on adding `#[stable]` to the new APIs.  The
    current usage with the `HashMap` and `HashSet` types is also reconciled by
    separating out composable parts of the design. The primary goal of this slight
    redesign is to separate the concepts of a hasher's state from a hashing
    algorithm itself.
    
    The primary change of this commit is to separate the `Hasher` trait into a
    `Hasher` and a `HashState` trait. Conceptually the old `Hasher` trait was
    actually just a factory for various states, but hashing had very little control
    over how these states were used. Additionally the old `Hasher` trait was
    actually fairly unrelated to hashing.
    
    This commit redesigns the existing `Hasher` trait to match what the notion of a
    `Hasher` normally implies with the following definition:
    
        trait Hasher {
            type Output;
            fn reset(&amp;mut self);
            fn finish(&amp;self) -&gt; Output;
        }

    than a `u64`, so the output type is made generic. Other than that, however, very
    little is assumed about a particular hasher. It is left up to implementors to
    provide specific methods or trait implementations to feed data into a hasher.

        trait Hash&lt;H: Hasher&gt; {
            fn hash(&amp;self, &amp;mut H);
        }

    rollup merge of #20615: aturon/stab-2-thread
    
    This commit takes a first pass at stabilizing `std::thread`:
    
    * It removes the `detach` method in favor of two constructors -- `spawn`
      for detached threads, `scoped` for "scoped" (i.e., must-join)
      threads. This addresses some of the surprise/frustrating debug
      sessions with the previous API, in which `spawn` produced a guard that
      on destruction joined the thread (unless `detach` was called).
    
      The reason to have the division in part is that `Send` will soon not
      imply `'static`, which means that `scoped` thread creation can take a
      closure over *shared stack data* of the parent thread. On the other
      hand, this means that the parent must not pop the relevant stack
      frames while the child thread is running. The `JoinGuard` is used to
      prevent this from happening by joining on drop (if you have not
      already explicitly `join`ed.) The APIs around `scoped` are
      future-proofed for the `Send` changes by taking an additional lifetime
      parameter. With the current definition of `Send`, this is forced to be
      `'static`, but when `Send` changes these APIs will gain their full
      flexibility immediately.
    
      Threads that are `spawn`ed, on the other hand, are detached from the
      start and do not yield an RAII guard.
    
      The hope is that, by making `scoped` an explicit opt-in with a very
      suggestive name, it will be drastically less likely to be caught by a
      surprising deadlock due to an implicit join at the end of a scope.
    
    * The module itself is marked stable.
    
    * Existing methods other than `spawn` and `scoped` are marked stable.
    
    The migration path is:
    
    ```rust
    Thread::spawn(f).detached()

    core: split into fmt::Show and fmt::String
    
    fmt::Show is for debugging, and can and should be implemented for
    all public types. This trait is used with `{:?}` syntax. There still
    exists #[derive(Show)].
    
    fmt::String is for types that faithfully be represented as a String.
    Because of this, there is no way to derive fmt::String, all
    implementations must be purposeful. It is used by the default format
    syntax, `{}`.
    
    This will break most instances of `{}`, since that now requires the type
    to impl fmt::String. In most cases, replacing `{}` with `{:?}` is the
    correct fix. Types that were being printed specifically for users should
    receive a fmt::String implementation to fix this.

    Implement impl reachability rules. This is a [breaking-change]. Type
    parameters on impls must now also appear in the trait ref, self type,
    or some associated type declared on the impl. This ensures that they
    are constrianed in some way and that the semantics of the trait system
    are well-defined (always a good thing).
    
    There are three major ways to fix this error:
    
    1. Convert the trait to use associated types; most often the type
       parameters are not constrained because they are in fact outputs of
       the impl.
    
    2. Move the type parameters to methods.
    
    3. Add an additional type parameter to the self type or trait so that
       the unused parameter can appear there.
    
    In some cases, it is not possible to fix the impl because the trait
    definition needs to be changed first (and that may be out of your
    control). In that case, for the time being, you can opt out of these
    rules by using `#[old_impl_check]` on the impl and adding a
    `#![feature(old_impl_check)]` to your crate declaration.

    rollup merge of #20507: alexcrichton/issue-20444
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 494][rfc] which removes the entire
    `std::c_vec` module and redesigns the `std::c_str` module as `std::ffi`.
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0494-c_str-and-c_vec-stability.md
    
    The interface of the new `CString` is outlined in the linked RFC, the primary
    changes being:
    
    * The `ToCStr` trait is gone, meaning the `with_c_str` and `to_c_str` methods
      are now gone. These two methods are replaced with a `CString::from_slice`
      method.
    * The `CString` type is now just a wrapper around `Vec&lt;u8&gt;` with a static
      guarantee that there is a trailing nul byte with no internal nul bytes. This
      means that `CString` now implements `Deref&lt;Target = [c_char]&gt;`, which is where
      it gains most of its methods from. A few helper methods are added to acquire a
      slice of `u8` instead of `c_char`, as well as including a slice with the
      trailing nul byte if necessary.
    * All usage of non-owned `CString` values is now done via two functions inside
      of `std::ffi`, called `c_str_to_bytes` and `c_str_to_bytes_with_nul`. These
      functions are now the one method used to convert a `*const c_char` to a Rust
      slice of `u8`.
    
    Many more details, including newly deprecated methods, can be found linked in
    the RFC. This is a:

    rollup merge of #20465: nikomatsakis/assoc-types-regions-20303
    
    Treat associated types the same as type parameters when it comes to region bounding. Fixes #20303.
    
    Strictly speaking, this is a [breaking-change] (if you are using
    associated types). You are no longer free to wantonly violate the type
    system rules by closing associated types into objects without any form
    of region bound. Instead you should add region bounds like `T::X :
    'a`, just as you would with a normal type parameter.

    auto merge of #20578 : japaric/rust/no-more-bc, r=nmatsakis
    
    This PR removes boxed closures from the language, the closure type syntax (`let f: |int| -&gt; bool = /* ... */`) has been obsoleted. Move all your uses of closures to the new unboxed closure system (i.e. `Fn*` traits).
    
    [breaking-change] patterns
    
    - `lef f = || {}`
    
    This binding used to type check to a boxed closure. Now that boxed closures are gone, you need to annotate the "kind" of the unboxed closure, i.e. you need pick one of these: `|&amp;:| {}`, `|&amp;mut:| {}` or `|:| {}`.
    
    In the (near) future we'll have closure "kind" inference, so the compiler will infer which `Fn*` trait to use based on how the closure is used. Once this inference machinery is in place, we'll be able to remove the kind annotation from most closures.
    
    - `type Alias&lt;'a&gt; = |int|:'a -&gt; bool`
    
    Use a trait object: `type Alias&lt;'a&gt; = Box&lt;FnMut(int) -&gt; bool + 'a&gt;`. Use the `Fn*` trait that makes sense for your use case.
    
    - `fn foo(&amp;self, f: |uint| -&gt; bool)`
    
    In this case you can use either a trait object or an unboxed closure:
    
    ``` rust
    fn foo(&amp;self, f: F) where F: FnMut(uint) -&gt; bool;
    // or
    fn foo(&amp;self, f: Box&lt;FnMut(uint) -&gt; bool&gt;);
    ```
    
    - `struct Struct&lt;'a&gt; { f: |uint|:'a -&gt; bool }`
    
    Again, you can use either a trait object or an unboxed closure:
    
    ``` rust
    struct Struct&lt;F&gt; where F: FnMut(uint) -&gt; bool { f: F }
    // or
    struct Struct&lt;'a&gt; { f: Box&lt;FnMut(uint) -&gt; bool + 'a&gt; }
    ```
    
    - Using `|x, y| f(x, y)` for closure "borrows"
    
    This comes up in recursive functions, consider the following (contrived) example:
    
    ``` rust
    fn foo(x: uint, f: |uint| -&gt; bool) -&gt; bool {
        //foo(x / 2, f) &amp;&amp; f(x)  // can't use this because `f` gets moved away in the `foo` call
        foo(x / 2, |x| f(x)) &amp;&amp; f(x)  // instead "borrow" `f` in the `foo` call
    }
    ```
    
    If you attempt to do the same with unboxed closures you'll hit ""error: reached the recursion limit during monomorphization" (see #19596):
    
    ``` rust
    fn foo&lt;F&gt;(x: uint, mut f: F) -&gt; bool where F: FnMut(uint) -&gt; bool {
        foo(x / 2, |x| f(x)) &amp;&amp; f(x)
        //~^ error: reached the recursion limit during monomorphization
    }
    ```
    
    Instead you *should* be able to write this:
    
    ``` rust
    fn foo&lt;F&gt;(x: uint, mut f: F) -&gt; bool where F: FnMut(uint) -&gt; bool {
        foo(x / 2, &amp;mut f) &amp;&amp; f(x)
        //~^ error: the trait `FnMut` is not implemented for the type `&amp;mut F`
    }
    ```
    
    But as you see above `&amp;mut F` doesn't implement the `FnMut` trait. `&amp;mut F` *should* implement the `FnMut` and the above code *should* work, but due to a bug (see #18835) it doesn't (for now).
    
    You can work around the issue by rewriting the function to take `&amp;mut F` instead of `F`:
    
    ``` rust
    fn foo&lt;F&gt;(x: uint, f: &amp;mut F) -&gt; bool where F: FnMut(uint) -&gt; bool {
        foo(x / 2, f) &amp;&amp; (*f)(x)
    }
    ```
    
    This finally works! However writing `foo(0, &amp;mut |x| x == 0)` is unergonomic. So you can use a private helper function to avoid this:
    
    ``` rust
    // public API function
    pub fn foo&lt;F&gt;(x: uint, mut f: F) -&gt; bool where F: FnMut(uint) -&gt; bool {
        foo_(x, &amp;mut f)
    }
    
    // private helper function
    fn foo_&lt;F&gt;(x: uint, f: &amp;mut F) -&gt; bool where F: FnMut(uint) -&gt; bool {
        foo_(x / 2, f) &amp;&amp; (*f)(x)
    }
    ```
    
    Closes #14798
    
    ---
    
    There is more cleanup to do: like renaming functions/types from `unboxed_closure` to just `closure`, removing more dead code, simplify functions which now have unused arguments, update the documentation, etc. But that can be done in another PR.

    Implement new orphan rule that requires that impls of remote traits meet the following two criteria:
    
    - the self type includes some local type; and,
    - type parameters in the self type must be constrained by a local type.
    
    A type parameter is called *constrained* if it appears in some type-parameter of a local type.
    
    Here are some examples that are accepted. In all of these examples, I
    assume that `Foo` is a trait defined in another crate. If `Foo` were
    defined in the local crate, then all the examples would be legal.
    
    - `impl Foo for LocalType`
    - `impl&lt;T&gt; Foo&lt;T&gt; for LocalType` -- T does not appear in Self, so it is OK
    - `impl&lt;T&gt; Foo&lt;T&gt; for LocalType&lt;T&gt;` -- T here is constrained by LocalType
    - `impl&lt;T&gt; Foo&lt;T&gt; for (LocalType&lt;T&gt;, T)` -- T here is constrained by LocalType
    
    Here are some illegal examples (again, these examples assume that
    `Foo` is not local to the current crate):
    
    - `impl Foo for int` -- the Self type is not local
    - `impl&lt;T&gt; Foo for T` -- T appears in Self unconstrained by a local type
    - `impl&lt;T&gt; Foo for (LocalType, T)` -- T appears in Self unconstrained by a local type
    
    This is a [breaking-change]. For the time being, you can opt out of
    the new rules by placing `#[old_orphan_check]` on the trait (and
    enabling the feature gate where the trait is defined). Longer term,
    you should restructure your traits to avoid the problem. Usually this
    means changing the order of parameters so that the "central" type
    parameter is in the `Self` position.
    
    As an example of that refactoring, consider the `BorrowFrom` trait:
    
    ```rust
    pub trait BorrowFrom&lt;Sized? Owned&gt; for Sized? {
        fn borrow_from(owned: &amp;Owned) -&gt; &amp;Self;
    }
    ```
    
    As defined, this trait is commonly implemented for custom pointer
    types, such as `Arc`. Those impls follow the pattern:
    
    ```rust
    impl&lt;T&gt; BorrowFrom&lt;Arc&lt;T&gt;&gt; for T {...}
    ```
    
    Unfortunately, this impl is illegal because the self type `T` is not
    local to the current crate. Therefore, we are going to change the order of the parameters,
    so that `BorrowFrom` becomes `Borrow`:
    
    ```rust
    pub trait Borrow&lt;Sized? Borrowed&gt; for Sized? {
        fn borrow_from(owned: &amp;Self) -&gt; &amp;Borrowed;
    }
    ```
    
    Now the `Arc` impl is written:
    
    ```rust
    impl&lt;T&gt; Borrow&lt;T&gt; for Arc&lt;T&gt; { ... }
    ```
    
    This impl is legal because the self type (`Arc&lt;T&gt;`) is local.

    Final alpha stabilization of core::iter
    
    This commit wraps up the adjustments to the iterator for recent language
    changes.
    
    * Moves `rposition` from `ExactSizeIterator` to `IteratorExt` using a
      `where` clause, thereby removing the `ExactSizeIterator:
      DoubleEndedIterator` constraint.
    
    * Merges `MutableDoubleEndedIterator` into `IteratorExt`, renaming
      `reverse_` to `reverse_in_place`.
    
    * Merges `IteratorOrdExt`, `IteratorCloneExt` and `CloneIteratorExt`
      into `IteratorExt` using `where` clauses.
    
    Marks as `#[stable]`:
    
    * the `iter` module itself
    * `FromIterator`, `Extend`
    * `Iterator`, `IteratorExt`
    * `map`
    * `filter`
    * `filter_map`
    * `skip_while`

    Change `&amp;` pat to only work with &amp;T, and `&amp;mut` with &amp;mut T.
    
    This implements RFC 179 by making the pattern `&amp;&lt;pat&gt;` require matching
    against a variable of type `&amp;T`, and introducing the pattern `&amp;mut
    &lt;pat&gt;` which only works with variables of type `&amp;mut T`.
    
    The pattern `&amp;mut x` currently parses as `&amp;(mut x)` i.e. a pattern match
    through a `&amp;T` or a `&amp;mut T` that binds the variable `x` to have type
    `T` and to be mutable. This should be rewritten as follows, for example,
    
        for &amp;mut x in slice.iter() {
    
    becomes
    
        for &amp;x in slice.iter() {

    The `Index[Mut]` traits now have one less input parameter, as the return type of the indexing operation is an associated type. This breaks all existing implementations.

    binop traits (`Add`, `Sub`, etc) now have an associated type for their return type. Also, the RHS input parameter now defaults to `Self` (except for the `Shl` and `Shr` traits). For example, the `Add` trait now looks like this:
    
    ``` rust
    trait Add&lt;Rhs=Self&gt; {

    This breaks all existing implementations of these traits.
    
    ---
    Affected traits:
    
    - `Iterator { type Item }`
    - `IteratorExt` no input/output types, uses `&lt;Self as Iterator&gt;::Item` in its methods
    - `DoubleEndedIterator` no input/output types, uses `&lt;Self as Iterator&gt;::Item` in its methods
    - `DoubleEndedIteratorExt` no input/output types, uses `&lt;Self as Iterator&gt;::Item` in its methods
    - `RandomAccessIterator` no input/output types
    - `ExactSizeIterator` no input/output types, uses `&lt;Self as Iterator&gt;::Item` in its methods
    
    This breaks all the implementations of these traits.

    This modifies `Parser::eat_lt` to always split up `&lt;&lt;`s, instead of doing so only when a lifetime name followed or the `force` parameter (now removed) was `true`. This is because `Foo&lt;&lt;TYPE` is now a valid start to a type, whereas previously only `Foo&lt;&lt;LIFETIME` was valid.
    
    This is a [breaking-change]. Change code that looks like this:
    
    ```rust
    let x = foo as bar &lt;&lt; 13;
    ```
    
    to use parentheses, like this:

    std: Stabilize the prelude module
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 503][rfc] which is a stabilization
    story for the prelude. Most of the RFC was directly applied, removing reexports.
    Some reexports are kept around, however:
    
    * `range` remains until range syntax has landed to reduce churn.
    * `Path` and `GenericPath` remain until path reform lands. This is done to
      prevent many imports of `GenericPath` which will soon be removed.
    * All `io` traits remain until I/O reform lands so imports can be rewritten all
      at once to `std::io::prelude::*`.
    
    This is a breaking change because many prelude reexports have been removed, and
    the RFC can be consulted for the exact list of removed reexports, as well as to
    find the locations of where to import them.

    Fix orphan checking (cc #19470). (This is not a complete fix of #19470 because of the backwards compatibility feature gate.)
    
    This is a [breaking-change]. The new rules require that, for an impl of a trait defined
    in some other crate, two conditions must hold:
    
    1. Some type must be local.
    2. Every type parameter must appear "under" some local type.
    
    Here are some examples that are legal:
    
    ```rust
    struct MyStruct&lt;T&gt; { ... }
    
    // Here `T` appears "under' `MyStruct`.
    impl&lt;T&gt; Clone for MyStruct&lt;T&gt; { }
    
    // Here `T` appears "under' `MyStruct` as well. Note that it also appears
    // elsewhere.
    impl&lt;T&gt; Iterator&lt;T&gt; for MyStruct&lt;T&gt; { }
    ```
    
    Here is an illegal example:
    
    ```rust
    // Here `U` does not appear "under" `MyStruct` or any other local type.
    // We call `U` "uncovered".
    impl&lt;T,U&gt; Iterator&lt;U&gt; for MyStruct&lt;T&gt; { }
    ```
    
    There are a couple of ways to rewrite this last example so that it is
    legal:
    
    1. In some cases, the uncovered type parameter (here, `U`) should be converted
       into an associated type. This is however a non-local change that requires access
       to the original trait. Also, associated types are not fully baked.
    2. Add `U` as a type parameter of `MyStruct`:
       ```rust
       struct MyStruct&lt;T,U&gt; { ... }
       impl&lt;T,U&gt; Iterator&lt;U&gt; for MyStruct&lt;T,U&gt; { }
       ```
    3. Create a newtype wrapper for `U`
       ```rust
       impl&lt;T,U&gt; Iterator&lt;Wrapper&lt;U&gt;&gt; for MyStruct&lt;T,U&gt; { }
       ```
    
    Because associated types are not fully baked, which in the case of the
    `Hash` trait makes adhering to this rule impossible, you can
    temporarily disable this rule in your crate by using
    `#![feature(old_orphan_check)]`. Note that the `old_orphan_check`
    feature will be removed before 1.0 is released.

    std: Second pass stabilization for `boxed`
    
    This commit performs a second pass over the `std::boxed` module, taking the
    following actions:
    
    * `boxed` is now stable
    * `Box` is now stable
    * `BoxAny` is removed in favor of a direct `impl Box&lt;Any&gt;`
    * `Box::downcast` remains unstable while the name of the `downcast` family of
      methods is determined.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the removal of the `BoxAny` trait (note that
    the `downcast` method still exists), and existing consumers of `BoxAny` simply
    need to remove the import in their modules.

    std: Enforce Unicode in fmt::Writer
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 526][rfc] which is a change to alter
    the definition of the old `fmt::FormatWriter`. The new trait, renamed to
    `Writer`, now only exposes one method `write_str` in order to guarantee that all
    implementations of the formatting traits can only produce valid Unicode.
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0526-fmt-text-writer.md
    
    One of the primary improvements of this patch is the performance of the
    `.to_string()` method by avoiding an almost-always redundant UTF-8 check. This
    is a breaking change due to the renaming of the trait as well as the loss of the
    `write` method, but migration paths should be relatively easy:
    
    * All usage of `write` should move to `write_str`. If truly binary data was
      being written in an implementation of `Show`, then it will need to use a
      different trait or an altogether different code path.
    
    * All usage of `write!` should continue to work as-is with no modifications.
    
    * All usage of `Show` where implementations just delegate to another should
      continue to work as-is.

    std: Second pass stabilization of sync
    
    This pass performs a second pass of stabilization through the `std::sync`
    module, avoiding modules/types that are being handled in other PRs (e.g.
    mutexes, rwlocks, condvars, and channels).
    
    The following items are now stable
    
    * `sync::atomic`
    * `sync::atomic::ATOMIC_BOOL_INIT` (was `INIT_ATOMIC_BOOL`)
    * `sync::atomic::ATOMIC_INT_INIT` (was `INIT_ATOMIC_INT`)
    * `sync::atomic::ATOMIC_UINT_INIT` (was `INIT_ATOMIC_UINT`)
    * `sync::Once`
    * `sync::ONCE_INIT`
    * `sync::Once::call_once` (was `doit`)
      * C == `pthread_once(..)`
      * Boost == `call_once(..)`
      * Windows == `InitOnceExecuteOnce`
    * `sync::Barrier`
    * `sync::Barrier::new`
    * `sync::Barrier::wait` (now returns a `bool`)
    * `sync::Semaphore::new`
    * `sync::Semaphore::acquire`
    * `sync::Semaphore::release`
    
    The following items remain unstable
    
    * `sync::SemaphoreGuard`
    * `sync::Semaphore::access` - it's unclear how this relates to the poisoning
                                  story of mutexes.
    * `sync::TaskPool` - the semantics of a failing task and whether a thread is
                         re-attached to a thread pool are somewhat unclear, and the
                         utility of this type in `sync` is question with respect to
                         the jobs of other primitives. This type will likely become
                         stable or move out of the standard library over time.
    * `sync::Future` - futures as-is have yet to be deeply re-evaluated with the
                       recent core changes to Rust's synchronization story, and will
                       likely become stable in the future but are unstable until
                       that time comes.

    This PR removes pretty much all the remaining uses of boxed closures from the libraries. There are still boxed closures under the `test` directory, but I think those should be removed or replaced with unboxed closures at the same time we remove boxed closures from the language.
    
    In a few places I had to do some contortions (see the first commit for an example) to work around issue #19596. I have marked those workarounds with FIXMEs. In the future when `&amp;mut F where F: FnMut` implements the `FnMut` trait, we should be able to remove those workarounds. I've take care to avoid placing the workaround functions in the public API.
    
    Since `let f = || {}` always gets type checked as a boxed closure, I have explictly annotated those closures (with e.g. `|&amp;:| {}`) to force the compiler to type check them as unboxed closures.
    
    Instead of removing the type aliases (like `GetCrateDataCb`), I could have replaced them with newtypes. But this seemed like overcomplicating things for little to no gain.
    
    I think we should be able to remove the boxed closures from the languge after this PR lands. (I'm being optimistic here)

    rustc: Re-jigger -L and -l for MSYS compatibility
    
    As discovered in #20376, the MSYS shell will silently rewrite arguemnts that
    look like unix paths into their windows path counterparts for compatibility, but
    the recently added `:kind` syntax added to the `-L` flag does not allow for this
    form of rewriting. This means that the syntax can be difficult to use at an MSYS
    prompt, as well as causing tests to fail when run manuall right now.
    
    This commit takes the other option presented in the original issue to prefix the
    path with `kind=` instead of suffixing it with `:kind`. For consistence, the
    `-l` flag is also now migrating to `kind=name`.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the *removal* of behavior with `-L`. All code
    using `:kind` should now pass `kind=` for `-L` arguments. This is not currently,
    but will become, a breaking change for `-l` flags. The old `name:kind` syntax is
    still accepted, but all code should update to `kind=name`.

    Stabilize cmp
    
    This patch marks `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `PartialOrd`, and `Ord` as
    `#[stable]`, as well as the majorify of manual implementaitons of these
    traits. The traits match the [reform
    RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/439).
    
    Along the way, two changes are made:
    
    * The recently-added type parameters for `Ord` and `Eq` are
      removed. These were mistakenly added while adding them to `PartialOrd`
      and `PartialEq`, but they don't make sense given the laws that are
      required for (and use cases for) `Ord` and `Eq`.
    
    * More explicit laws are added for `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd`,
      connecting them to their associated mathematical concepts.
    
    In the future, many of the impls should be generalized; see
    since generalizing later is not a breaking change.

    Libs: Unify concat and concat_vec
    
    We've long had traits `StrVector` and `VectorVector` providing
    `concat`/`connect` and `concat_vec`/`connect_vec` respectively. The
    reason for the distinction is that coherence rules did not used to be
    robust enough to allow impls on e.g. `Vec&lt;String&gt;` versus `Vec&lt;&amp;[T]&gt;`.
    
    This commit consolidates the traits into a single `SliceConcatExt` trait
    provided by `slice` and the preldue (where it replaces `StrVector`,
    which is removed.)

    rollup merge of #19661: alexcrichton/mutex-result
    
    All of the current std::sync primitives have poisoning enable which means that
    when a task fails inside of a write-access lock then all future attempts to
    acquire the lock will fail. This strategy ensures that stale data whose
    invariants are possibly not upheld are never viewed by other tasks to help
    propagate unexpected panics (bugs in a program) among tasks.
    
    Currently there is no way to test whether a mutex or rwlock is poisoned. One
    method would be to duplicate all the methods with a sister foo_catch function,
    for example. This pattern is, however, against our [error guidelines][errors].
    As a result, this commit exposes the fact that a task has failed internally
    through the return value of a `Result`.
    
    [errors]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0236-error-conventions.md#do-not-provide-both-result-and-fail-variants
    
    All methods now return a `LockResult&lt;T&gt;` or a `TryLockResult&lt;T&gt;` which
    communicates whether the lock was poisoned or not. In a `LockResult`, both the
    `Ok` and `Err` variants contains the `MutexGuard&lt;T&gt;` that is being returned in
    order to allow access to the data if poisoning is not desired. This also means
    that the lock is *always* held upon returning from `.lock()`.
    
    A new type, `PoisonError`, was added with one method `into_guard` which can
    consume the assertion that a lock is poisoned to gain access to the underlying
    data.
    
    This is a breaking change because the signatures of these methods have changed,
    often incompatible ways. One major difference is that the `wait` methods on a
    condition variable now consume the guard and return it in as a `LockResult` to
    indicate whether the lock was poisoned while waiting. Most code can be updated
    by calling `.unwrap()` on the return value of `.lock()`.

    The `mut` in slices is now redundant. Mutability is 'inferred' from position. This means that if mutability is only obvious from the type, you will need to use explicit calls to the slicing methods.

    std: Second pass stabilization for `comm`
    
    This commit is a second pass stabilization for the `std::comm` module,
    performing the following actions:
    
    * The entire `std::comm` module was moved under `std::sync::mpsc`. This movement
      reflects that channels are just yet another synchronization primitive, and
      they don't necessarily deserve a special place outside of the other
      concurrency primitives that the standard library offers.
    * The `send` and `recv` methods have all been removed.
    * The `send_opt` and `recv_opt` methods have been renamed to `send` and `recv`.
      This means that all send/receive operations return a `Result` now indicating
      whether the operation was successful or not.
    * The error type of `send` is now a `SendError` to implement a custom error
      message and allow for `unwrap()`. The error type contains an `into_inner`
      method to extract the value.
    * The error type of `recv` is now `RecvError` for the same reasons as `send`.
    * The `TryRecvError` and `TrySendError` types have had public reexports removed
      of their variants and the variant names have been tweaked with enum
      namespacing rules.
    * The `Messages` iterator is renamed to `Iter`
    
    This functionality is now all `#[stable]`:
    
    * `Sender`
    * `SyncSender`
    * `Receiver`
    * `std::sync::mpsc`
    * `channel`
    * `sync_channel`
    * `Iter`
    * `Sender::send`
    * `Sender::clone`
    * `SyncSender::send`
    * `SyncSender::try_send`
    * `SyncSender::clone`
    * `Receiver::recv`
    * `Receiver::try_recv`
    * `Receiver::iter`
    * `SendError`
    * `RecvError`
    * `TrySendError::{mod, Full, Disconnected}`
    * `TryRecvError::{mod, Empty, Disconnected}`
    * `SendError::into_inner`
    * `TrySendError::into_inner`
    
    This is a breaking change due to the modification of where this module is
    located, as well as the changing of the semantics of `send` and `recv`. Most
    programs just need to rename imports of `std::comm` to `std::sync::mpsc` and
    add calls to `unwrap` after a send or a receive operation.

    auto merge of #20058 : Kimundi/rust/str_pattern_pre, r=alexcrichton
    
    This stabilizes most methods on `&amp;str` working with patterns in a way that is forwards-compatible with a generic string pattern matching API:
    - Methods that are using the primary name for their operation are marked as `#[stable]`, as they can be upgraded to a full `Pattern` API later without existing code breaking. Example: `contains(&amp;str)`
    - Methods that are using a more specific name in order to not clash with the primary one are marked as `#[unstable]`, as they will likely be removed once their functionality is merged into the primary one. Example: `contains_char&lt;C: CharEq&gt;(C)`
    - The method docs got changed to consistently refer to the pattern types as a pattern.
    - Methods whose names do not match in the context of the more generic API got renamed. Example: `trim_chars -&gt; trim_matches`
    
    Additionally, all methods returning iterators got changed to return unique new types with changed names in accordance with the new naming guidelines.

    std: Stabilize the prelude module
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 503][rfc] which is a stabilization
    story for the prelude. Most of the RFC was directly applied, removing reexports.
    Some reexports are kept around, however:
    
    * `range` remains until range syntax has landed to reduce churn.
    * `Path` and `GenericPath` remain until path reform lands. This is done to
      prevent many imports of `GenericPath` which will soon be removed.
    * All `io` traits remain until I/O reform lands so imports can be rewritten all
      at once to `std::io::prelude::*`.
    
    This is a breaking change because many prelude reexports have been removed, and
    the RFC can be consulted for the exact list of removed reexports, as well as to
    find the locations of where to import them.

    This and the other commit in this PR change the rules for shadowing and globs to be
    stricter. There were previously bugs where some glob imports would not be checked
    for shadowing. Those are now fixed and you may have to adjust your imports to use
    fewer globs.

    We have the technology: no longer do you need to write closures to use `format_args!`.
    This is a `[breaking-change]`, as it forces you to clean up old hacks - if you had code like this:
    ```rust
    format_args!(fmt::format, "{} {} {}", a, b, c)
    format_args!(|args| { w.write_fmt(args) }, "{} {} {}", x, y, z)
    ```
    change it to this:
    ```rust
    fmt::format(format_args!("{} {} {}", a, b, c))
    w.write_fmt(format_args!("{} {} {}", x, y, z))
    ```
    To allow them to be called with `format_args!(...)` directly, several functions were modified to
    take `fmt::Arguments` by value instead of by reference. Also, `fmt::Arguments` derives `Copy`
    now in order to preserve all usecases that were previously possible.

    auto merge of #19916 : SimonSapin/rust/ascii-reform, r=sfackler
    
    Implements [RFC 486](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/486). Fixes #19908.
    
    * Rename `to_ascii_{lower,upper}` to `to_ascii_{lower,upper}case`, per #14401
    * Remove the `Ascii` type and associated traits: `AsciiCast`, `OwnedAsciiCast`, `AsciiStr`, `IntoBytes`, and `IntoString`.
    * As a replacement, add `.is_ascii()` to `AsciiExt`, and implement `AsciiExt` for `u8` and `char`.

    save-analysis: emit names of items that a glob import actually imports.
    
    There is also some work here to make resolve a bit more stable - it no longer overwrites a specific import with a glob import.
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    Import shadowing of single/list imports by globs is now forbidden. An interesting case is where a glob import imports a re-export (`pub use`) of a single import. This still counts as a single import for the purposes of shadowing .You can usually fix any bustage by re-ordering such imports. A single import may still shadow (override) a glob import or the prelude.

    Parse fully-qualified associated types in generics without whitespace
    
    This breaks code that looks like this:
    
        let x = foo as bar &lt;&lt; 13;
    
    Change such code to look like this:
    
        let x = (foo as bar) &lt;&lt; 13;
    
    Closes #17362.

    auto merge of #20117 : lfairy/rust/rename-include-bin, r=alexcrichton
    
    According to [RFC 344][], methods that return `&amp;[u8]` should have names ending in `bytes`. Though `include_bin!` is a macro not a method, it seems reasonable to follow the convention anyway.
    
    We keep the old name around for now, but trigger a deprecation warning when it is used.

    This pull request:
    
    *Renames `BinaryHeap::top` to `BinaryHeap::peek`
    *Stabilizes `front/back/front_mut/back_mut` in `DList` and `RingBuf`
    *Stabilizes `swap` in `RingBuf`
    
    in accordance with rust-lang/rfcs#509.
    
    Note that this PR does not address `Bitv::{get,set}` or HashMap's iterators, nor does it move `std::vec` to `std::collections::vec`, all of which still need to be done.
    
    Because of the method renaming, this is a [breaking-change].

    rollup merge of #20033: alexcrichton/deprecate-serialise
    
    This commit completes the deprecation story for the in-tree serialization
    library. The compiler will now emit a warning whenever it encounters
    `deriving(Encodable)` or `deriving(Decodable)`, and the library itself is now
    marked `#[unstable]` for when feature staging is enabled.
    
    All users of serialization can migrate to the `rustc-serialize` crate on
    crates.io which provides the exact same interface as the libserialize library
    in-tree. The new deriving modes are named `RustcEncodable` and `RustcDecodable`
    and require `extern crate "rustc-serialize" as rustc_serialize` at the crate
    root in order to expand correctly.
    
    To migrate all crates, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
    
        [dependencies]
        rustc-serialize = "0.1.1"
    
    And then add the following to your crate root:
    
        extern crate "rustc-serialize" as rustc_serialize;
    
    Finally, rename `Encodable` and `Decodable` deriving modes to `RustcEncodable`
    and `RustcDecodable`.
