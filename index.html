    Auto merge of #33124 - sfackler:kill-ipv6-only, r=alexcrichton
    
    Remove IPV6_V6ONLY functionality
    
    These settings can only be adjusted before bind time, which doesn't make
    sense in the current set of functionality. These methods are stable, but
    haven't hit a stable release yet.
    
    Closes #33052

    Will also need a backport to the beta.

    Auto merge of #32939 - eddyb:layout, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Compute LLVM-agnostic type layouts in rustc.
    
    Layout for monomorphic types, and some polymorphic ones (e.g. `&amp;T` where `T: Sized`),
    can now be computed by rustc without involving LLVM in the actual process.
    
    This gives rustc the ability to evaluate `size_of` or `align_of`, as well as obtain field offsets.
    MIR-based CTFE will eventually make use of these layouts, as will MIR trans, shortly.
    
    Layout computation also comes with a `[breaking-change]`, or two:
    * `"data-layout"` is now mandatory in custom target specifications, reverting the decision from #27076.
    This string is needed because it describes endianness, pointer size and alignments for various types.
    We have the first two and we could allow tweaking alignments in target specifications.
    Or we could also extract the data layout from LLVM and feed it back into rustc.
    However, that can vary with the LLVM version, which is fragile and undermines stability.
    For built-in targets, I've added a check that the hardcoded data-layout matches LLVM defaults.
    * `transmute` calls are checked in a stricter fashion, which fixes #32377
    
    To expand on `transmute`, there are only 2 allowed patterns: between types with statically known sizes and between pointers with the same potentially-unsized "tail" (which determines the type of unsized metadata they use, if any).
    If you're affected, my suggestions are:
    * try to use casts (and raw pointer deref) instead of transmutes
    * *really* try to avoid `transmute` where possible
    * if you have a structure, try working on individual fields and unpack/repack the structure instead of transmuting it whole, e.g. `transmute::&lt;RefCell&lt;Box&lt;T&gt;&gt;, RefCell&lt;*mut T&gt;&gt;(x)` doesn't work, but `RefCell::new(Box::into_raw(x.into_inner()))` does (and `Box::into_raw` is just a `transmute`)

    Rollup merge of #32923 - jseyfried:fix_hygiene, r=nrc
    
    Fix macro hygiene bug
    
    This fixes #32922 (EDIT: and fixes #31856), macro hygiene bugs.
    It is a [breaking-change]. For example, the following would break:
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let x = true;
        macro_rules! foo { () =&gt; {
            let x = 0;
            macro_rules! bar { () =&gt; {x} }
            let _: bool = bar!();
            //^ `bar!()` used to resolve the first `x` (a bool),
            //| but will now resolve to the second x (an i32).
        }}
        foo! {};
    }
    ```

    Rollup merge of #32682 - petrochenkov:field3, r=Manishearth
    
     The AST part of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31937
    
    Unlike HIR, AST still uses `Option` for field names because parser can't know field indexes reliably due to constructions like
    ```
    struct S(#[cfg(false)] u8, u8); // The index of the second field changes from 1 during parsing to 0 after expansion.
    ```
    and I wouldn't like to put the burden of renaming fields on expansion passes and syntax extensions.

    [breaking-batch] Add support for `pub(restricted)` syntax in the AST
    
    This PR allows the AST to represent the `pub(restricted)` syntax from RFC 1422 (cc #32409).
    
    More specifically, it makes `ast::Visibility` non-`Copy` and adds two new variants, `Visibility::Crate` for `pub(crate)` and `Visitibility::Restricted { path: P&lt;Path&gt;, id: NodeId }` for `pub(path)`.

    Auto merge of #32479 - eddyb:eof-not-even-twice, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Prevent bumping the parser past the EOF.
    
    Makes `Parser::bump` after EOF into an ICE, forcing callers to avoid repeated EOF bumps.
    This ICE is intended to break infinite loops where EOF wasn't stopping the loop.
    
    For example, the handling of EOF in `parse_trait_items`' recovery loop fixes #32446.
    But even without this specific fix, the ICE is triggered, which helps diagnosis and UX.
    
    This is a `[breaking-change]` for plugins authors who eagerly eat multiple EOFs.
    See https://github.com/docopt/docopt.rs/pull/171 for such an example and the necessary fix.

    Rollup merge of #32199 - nikomatsakis:limiting-constants-in-patterns-2, r=pnkfelix
    
    Restrict constants in patterns
    
    This implements [RFC 1445](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1445-restrict-constants-in-patterns.md). The primary change is to limit the types of constants used in patterns to those that *derive* `Eq` (note that implementing `Eq` is not sufficient). This has two main effects:
    
    1. Floating point constants are linted, and will eventually be disallowed. This is because floating point constants do not implement `Eq` but only `PartialEq`. This check replaces the existing special case code that aimed to detect the use of `NaN`.
    2. Structs and enums must derive `Eq` to be usable within a match.
    
    This is a [breaking-change]: if you encounter a problem, you are most likely using a constant in an expression where the type of the constant is some struct that does not currently implement
    `Eq`. Something like the following:
    
    ```rust
    struct SomeType { ... }
    const SOME_CONST: SomeType = ...;
    
    match foo {
        SOME_CONST =&gt; ...
    }
    ```
    
    The easiest and most future compatible fix is to annotate the type in question with `#[derive(Eq)]` (note that merely *implementing* `Eq` is not enough, it must be *derived*):
    
    ```rust
    struct SomeType { ... }
    const SOME_CONST: SomeType = ...;
    
    match foo {
        SOME_CONST =&gt; ...
    }
    ```
    
    Another good option is to rewrite the match arm to use an `if` condition (this is also particularly good for floating point types, which implement `PartialEq` but not `Eq`):
    
    ```rust
    match foo {
        c if c == SOME_CONST =&gt; ...
    }
    ```
    
    Finally, a third alternative is to tag the type with `#[structural_match]`; but this is not recommended, as the attribute is never expected to be stabilized. Please see RFC #1445 for more details.

    Disallow methods from traits that are not in scope

    This is a [breaking-change]. For example, the following would break:
    ```rust
    mod foo {

    }

    issue a future-compat lint for constants of invalid type
    
    This is a [breaking-change]: according to RFC #1445, constants used as
    patterns must be of a type that *derives* `Eq`. If you encounter a
    problem, you are most likely using a constant in an expression where the
    type of the constant is some struct that does not currently implement
    `Eq`. Something like the following:
    
    ```rust
    struct SomeType { ... }
    const SOME_CONST: SomeType = ...;
    
    match foo {
        SOME_CONST =&gt; ...
    }
    ```
    
    The easiest and most future compatible fix is to annotate the type in
    question with `#[derive(Eq)]` (note that merely *implementing* `Eq` is
    not enough, it must be *derived*):
    
    ```rust
    struct SomeType { ... }
    const SOME_CONST: SomeType = ...;
    
    match foo {
        SOME_CONST =&gt; ...
    }
    ```
    
    Another good option is to rewrite the match arm to use an `if`
    condition (this is also particularly good for floating point types,
    which implement `PartialEq` but not `Eq`):
    
    ```rust
    match foo {
        c if c == SOME_CONST =&gt; ...
    }
    ```

    `#[structural_match]`; but this is not recommended, as the attribute is

    Auto merge of #32141 - jseyfried:fix_resolution_in_lexical_scopes, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Fix name resolution in lexical scopes
    
    Currently, `resolve_item_in_lexical_scope` does not check the "ribs" (type parameters and local variables). This can allow items that should be shadowed by type parameters to be named.
    
    For example,
    ```rust
    struct T { i: i32 }
    fn f&lt;T&gt;() {
        let t = T { i: 0 }; // This use of `T` resolves to the struct, not the type parameter
    }
    
    mod Foo {
        pub fn f() {}
    }
    fn g&lt;Foo&gt;() {
        Foo::f(); // This use of `Foo` resolves to the module, not the type parameter
    }
    ```
    
    This PR changes `resolve_item_in_lexical_scope` so that it fails when the item is shadowed by a rib (fixes #32120).
    This is a [breaking-change], but it looks unlikely to cause breakage in practice.

    Forbid glob-importing from a type alias
    
    This PR forbids glob-importing from a type alias or trait (fixes #30560):
    ```rust
    type Alias = ();
    use Alias::*; // This is currently allowed but shouldn't be
    ```
    
    This is a [breaking-change]. Since the disallowed glob imports don't actually import anything, any breakage can be fixed by removing the offending glob import.

    Auto merge of #31710 - eddyb:reify, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Distinguish fn item types to allow reification from nothing to fn pointers.
    
    The first commit is a rebase of #26284, except for files that have moved since.
    
    This is a [breaking-change], due to:
    * each FFI function has a distinct type, like all other functions currently do
    * all generic parameters on functions are recorded in their item types, e.g.:
    `size_of::&lt;u8&gt;` &amp; `size_of::&lt;i8&gt;`'s types differ despite their identical signature.
    * function items are zero-sized, which will stop transmutes from working on them
    
    The first two cases are handled in most cases with the new coerce-unify logic,
    which will combine incompatible function item types into function pointers,
    at the outer-most level of if-else chains, match arms and array literals.
    
    The last case is specially handled during type-checking such that transmutes
    from a function item type to a pointer or integer type will continue to work for
    another release cycle, but are being linted against. To get rid of warnings and
    ensure your code will continue to compile, cast to a pointer before transmuting.

    Auto merge of #32006 - jseyfried:fix_expanded_mod_path, r=nikomatsakis
    
    This PR changes the search paths for macro-expanded non-inline modules so that they match ordinary non-inline modules (fixes #31624). This is a [breaking-change].
    
    Right now, the search paths for a macro-expanded non-inline module are computed as if the module were declared in the top level of the file in which the macro was defined.
    For example, consider `./foo/mod.rs`:
    ```rust
    mod inconsequential { // moving the macro outside this module wouldn't change anything
        macro_rules! mod_decl {
            ($i:ident) =&gt; { mod $i; }
        }
    }
    ```
    and `./lib.rs`:
    ```rust
    mod foo;
    
    mod bar {
        mod_decl!(baz);
        //^ Now, rustc expects `./foo/baz.rs` (or `./foo/baz/mod.rs`)

    Auto merge of #31824 - jseyfried:privacy_in_resolve, r=nikomatsakis
    
    This PR privacy checks paths as they are resolved instead of in `librustc_privacy` (fixes #12334 and fixes #31779). This removes the need for the `LastPrivate` system introduced in PR #9735, the limitations of which cause #31779.
    
    This PR also reports privacy violations in paths to intra- and inter-crate items the same way -- it always reports the first inaccessible segment of the path.
    
    Since it fixes #31779, this is a [breaking-change]. For example, the following code would break:
    ```rust
    mod foo {
        pub use foo::bar::S;
        mod bar { // `bar` should be private to `foo`
            pub struct S;

    }

    Rollup merge of #31904 - bluss:writer-formatter-error, r=alexcrichton
    
    Make sure formatter errors are emitted by the default Write::write_fmt
    
    Previously, if an error was returned from the formatter that did not
    originate in an underlying writer error, Write::write_fmt would return
    successfully even if the formatting did not complete (was interrupted by
    an `fmt::Error` return).
    
    Now we choose to emit an io::Error with kind Other for formatter errors.
    
    Since this may reveal error returns from `write!()` and similar that
    previously passed silently, it's a kind of a [breaking-change].
    
    Fixes #31879

    Auto merge of #31857 - jseyfried:fix_scoping, r=nikomatsakis
    
    This fixes a bug (#31845) introduced in #31105 in which lexical scopes contain items from all anonymous module ancestors, even if the path to the anonymous module includes a normal module:
    ```rust
    fn f() {
        fn g() {}
        mod foo {
            fn h() {
               g(); // This erroneously resolves on nightly
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    This is a [breaking-change] on nightly but not on stable or beta.

    Make sure formatter errors are emitted by the default Write::write_fmt
    
    Previously, if an error was returned from the formatter that did not
    originate in an underlying writer error, Write::write_fmt would return
    successfully even if the formatting did not complete (was interrupted by
    an `fmt::Error` return).
    
    Now we choose to emit an io::Error with kind Other for formatter errors.
    
    Since this may reveal error returns from `write!()` and similar that
    previously passed silently, it's a kind of a [breaking-change].

    Auto merge of #31534 - jseyfried:restrict_noninline_mod, r=nikomatsakis
    
    This PR disallows non-inline modules without path annotations that are either in a block or in an inline module whose containing file is not a directory owner (fixes #29765).
    This is a [breaking-change].

    Auto merge of #31581 - petrochenkov:patrefact, r=Manishearth
    
    cc https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31487#issuecomment-182945101
    plugin-[breaking-change]
    
    The first commit renames `ast::Pat_` to `ast::PatKind` and uses its variants in enum qualified form. I've also taken the opportunity and renamed `PatKind::Region` into `PatKind::Ref`.
    
    The second commit splits `PatKind::Enum` into `PatKind::TupleStruct` and `PatKind::UnitStruct`.
    So, pattern kinds now correspond to their struct/variant kinds - `Struct`, `TupleStruct` and `UnitStruct`.
    @nikomatsakis @nrc @arielb1 Are you okay with this naming scheme?
    An alternative possible naming scheme is `PatKind::StructVariant`, `PatKind::TupleVariant`, `PatKind::UnitVariant` (it's probably closer to the common use, but I like it less).
    
    I intend to apply these changes to HIR later, they should not necessarily go in the same nightly with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31487

    Auto merge of #31461 - jseyfried:remove_import_resolutions, r=nrc
    
    This PR adds to `NameBinding` so it can more fully represent bindings from imports as well from items, refactors away `Target`, generalizes `ImportResolution` to a simpler type `NameResolution`, and uses a single `NameResolution`-valued map in place the existing maps `children` and `import_resolutions` (of `NameBinding`s and `ImportResolution`s, respectively), simplifying duplicate checking and name resolution.
    
    It also unifies the `resolve_name_in_module` in `lib.rs` with its namesake in `resolve_imports.rs`, clarifying and improving the core logic (fixes #31403 and fixes #31404) while maintaining clear future-comparability with shadowable globs (i.e., never reporting that a resolution is a `Success` or is `Failing` unless this would also be knowable with shadowable globs).
    
    Since it fixes #31403, this is technically a [breaking-change], but it is exceedingly unlikely to cause breakage in practice. The following is an example of code that would break:
    ```rust
    mod foo {
        pub mod bar {} // This defines bar in the type namespace
        pub use alpha::bar; // This defines bar in the value namespace
    
        // This should define baz in both namespaces, but it only defines baz in the type namespace.
        pub use self::bar as baz;
        pub fn baz() {} // This should collide with baz, but now it does not.
    }
    
    pub fn f() {}
    mod alpha {
        pub use self::f as bar; // Changing this to `pub fn bar() {}` causes the collision right now.
        pub use super::*;
    }
    ```

    Auto merge of #31333 - lambda:31273-abort-on-stack-overflow, r=brson
    
    Abort on stack overflow instead of re-raising SIGSEGV
    
    We use guard pages that cause the process to abort to protect against
    undefined behavior in the event of stack overflow.  We have a handler
    that catches segfaults, prints out an error message if the segfault was
    due to a stack overflow, then unregisters itself and returns to allow
    the signal to be re-raised and kill the process.
    
    This caused some confusion, as it was unexpected that safe code would be
    able to cause a segfault, while it's easy to overflow the stack in safe
    code.  To avoid this confusion, when we detect a segfault in the guard
    page, abort instead of the previous behavior of re-raising SIGSEGV.
    
    To test this, we need to adapt the tests for segfault to actually check
    the exit status.  Doing so revealed that the existing test for segfault
    behavior was actually invalid; LLVM optimizes the explicit null pointer
    reference down to an illegal instruction, so the program aborts with
    SIGILL instead of SIGSEGV and the test didn't actually trigger the
    signal handler at all.  Use a C helper function to get a null pointer
    that LLVM can't optimize away, so we get our segfault instead.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] if anyone is relying on the exact signal
    raised to kill a process on stack overflow.
    
    Closes #31273

    Auto merge of #30866 - jseyfried:fix_shadowed_use_visibility, r=nrc
    
    This reverts PR #30324, fixing bug #30159 in which a public a glob import makes public any preceding imports that share a name with an item in the module being glob imported from.
    
    For example,
    ```rust
    pub fn f() {}
    pub mod foo {
        fn f() {}
    }
    
    mod bar {
        use f;
        use f as g;
        pub use foo::*; // This makes the first import public but does not affect the second import.
    }
    ```
    
    This is a [breaking-change].

    Auto merge of #31105 - jseyfried:fix_lexical_scoping, r=nrc
    
    This fixes #23880, a scoping bug in which items in a block are shadowed by local variables and type parameters that are in scope.
    
    After this PR, an item in a block will shadow any local variables or type parameters above the item in the scope hierarchy. Items in a block will continue to be shadowed by local variables in the same block (even if the item is defined after the local variable).
    
    This is a [breaking-change]. For example, the following code breaks:
    ```rust
    fn foo() {
        let mut f = 1;
        {
            fn f() {}
            f += 1; // This will resolve to the function instead of the local variable
        }
    }

    Auto merge of #30882 - petrochenkov:varnamesp, r=nrc
    
    Tuple and unit variants from other crates weren't put into type namespace.
    Now variant namespacing is aligned with struct namespacing and is not affected by the variant's crate of origin (struct -&gt; type, tuple/unit -&gt; type/value).
    Additionally, struct variants from other crates are put into value namespace (struct variants from local crate were already in it). This is not a necessity, but a future proofing measure.
    
    This fix can result in some new shadowing errors in cross-crate scenarios, crater reports [three regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30882#issuecomment-172369883).

    Auto merge of #29498 - wthrowe:replace-pattern, r=alexcrichton
    
    It appears this was left out of RFC rust-lang/rfcs#528 because it might be useful to
    also generalize the second argument in some way.  That doesn't seem to
    prevent generalizing the first argument now, however.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] because it could cause type-inference to
    fail where it previously succeeded.
    
    Also update docs for a few other methods that still referred to `&amp;str` instead of patterns.

    Auto merge of #30295 - jseyfried:fix_extern_crate_duplicate, r=nrc
    
    Fix a bug allowing an item and an external crate to collide so long as the external crate is declared after the item. For example,
    ```rust
    mod core { pub fn f() {} } // This would be an error if it followed the `extern crate`
    extern crate core; // This declaration is shadowed by the preceding module
    
    fn main() { core::f(); }
    ```
    This is a [breaking-change], but it looks unlikely to cause breakage in practice, and any breakage can be fixed by removing colliding `extern crate` declarations, which are shadowed and hence unused.

    Auto merge of #30724 - nikomatsakis:feature-gate-defaulted-type-parameters, r=pnkfelix
    
    It was recently realized that we accept defaulted type parameters everywhere, without feature gate, even though the only place that we really *intended* to accept them were on types. This PR adds a lint warning unless the "type-parameter-defaults" feature is enabled. This should eventually become a hard error.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] in that new feature gates are required (or simply removing the defaults, which is probably a better choice as they have little effect at this time). Results of a [crater run][crater] suggest that approximately 5-15 crates are affected. I didn't do the measurement quite right so that run cannot distinguish "true" regressions from "non-root" regressions, but even the upper bound of 15 affected crates seems relatively minimal.

    Auto merge of #30532 - nikomatsakis:cross-item-dependencies, r=mw
    
    This is roughly the same as my previous PR that created a dependency graph, but that:
    
    1. The dependency graph is only optionally constructed, though this doesn't seem to make much of a difference in terms of overhead (see measurements below).
    2. The dependency graph is simpler (I combined a lot of nodes).
    3. The dependency graph debugging facilities are much better: you can now use `RUST_DEP_GRAPH_FILTER` to filter the dep graph to just the nodes you are interested in, which is super help.
    4. The tests are somewhat more elaborate, including a few known bugs I need to fix in a second pass.
    
    This is potentially a `[breaking-change]` for plugin authors. If you are poking about in tcx state or something like that, you probably want to add `let _ignore = tcx.dep_graph.in_ignore();`, which will cause your reads/writes to be ignored and not affect the dep-graph.
    
    After this, or perhaps as an add-on to this PR in some cases, what I would like to do is the following:
    
    - [x] Write-up a little guide to how to use this system, the debugging options available, and what the possible failure modes are.
    - [ ] Introduce read-only and perhaps the `Meta` node
    - [x] Replace "memoization tasks" with node from the map itself
    - [ ] Fix the shortcomings, obviously! Notably, the HIR map needs to register reads, and there is some state that is not yet tracked. (Maybe as a separate PR.)
    - [x] Refactor the dep-graph code so that the actual maintenance of the dep-graph occurs in a parallel thread, and the main thread simply throws things into a shared channel (probably a fixed-size channel). There is no reason for dep-graph construction to be on the main thread. (Maybe as a separate PR.)
    
    Regarding performance: adding this tracking does add some overhead, approximately 2% in my measurements (I was comparing the build times for rustdoc). Interestingly, enabling or disabling tracking doesn't seem to do very much. I want to poke at this some more and gather a bit more data -- in some tests I've seen that 2% go away, but on others it comes back. It's not entirely clear to me if that 2% is truly due to constructing the dep-graph at all.
    
    The next big step after this is write some code to dump the dep-graph to disk and reload it.

    Auto merge of #29973 - petrochenkov:privinpub, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Some notes:
    This patch enforces the rules from [RFC 136](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0136-no-privates-in-public.md) and makes "private in public" a module-level concept and not crate-level. Only `pub` annotations are used by the new algorithm, crate-level exported node set produced by `EmbargoVisitor` is not used. The error messages are tweaked accordingly and don't use the word "exported" to avoid confusing people (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29668).
    
    The old algorithm tried to be extra smart with impls, but it mostly led to unpredictable behavior and bugs like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28325.
    The new algorithm tries to be as simple as possible - an impl is considered public iff its type is public and its trait is public (if presents).
    A type or trait is considered public if all its components are public, [complications](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/limits-of-type-inference-smartness/2919) with private types leaking to other crates/modules through trait impls and type inference are deliberately ignored so far.
    
    The new algorithm is not recursive and uses the nice new facility `Crate::visit_all_items`!
    
    Obsolete pre-1.0 feature `visible_private_types` is removed.
    
    This is a [breaking-change].
    The two main vectors of breakage are type aliases (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28450) and impls (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28325).
    I need some statistics from a crater run (cc @alexcrichton) to decide on the breakage mitigation strategy.
    UPDATE: All the new errors are reported as warnings controlled by a lint `private_in_public` and lint group `future_incompatible`, but the intent is to make them hard errors eventually.

    This reduces iteration time (`make rustc-stage1`) for moved syntax extensions from 11 minutes to 3 minutes on my machine.
    
    Because of the signature change, this is a [breaking-change] for people directly calling `expand_crate`. I think it is rare: from GitHub search, only case I found is [glassful](https://github.com/kmcallister/glassful).

    Auto merge of #30294 - jseyfried:fix_shadowed_use_visibility, r=nrc
    
    This fixes a bug in which the visibility of a use declaration defining a name in one namespace (e.g. the value namespace) is overridden by a later use declaration defining the same name in the other namespace (e.g. the type namespace). For example,
    ```rust
    fn f() {}
    pub mod bar {}
    
    mod foo {
        use f; // This import should not be visible outside `foo`,
        pub use bar as f; // but it visible outside of `foo` because of this import.
    }
    
    fn main() { foo::f(); }
    ```
    As the example demonstrates, this is a [breaking-change], but it looks unlikely to cause breakage in practice, and any breakage can be fixed by correcting visibility modifiers.

    Let str::replace take a pattern
    
    It appears this was left out of RFC #528 because it might be useful to
    also generalize the second argument in some way.  That doesn't seem to
    prevent generalizing the first argument now, however.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] because it could cause type-inference to
    fail where it previously succeeded.

    Auto merge of #30247 - bluss:revert-array-clone, r=alexcrichton
    
    Revert "PR #30130 Implement `Clone` for more arrays"
    
    This reverts commit e22a64e8d8d4da46c74f878ce1c23ad1c88982e8.
    
    This caused a regression such that types like `[[u8; 256]; 4]`
    no longer implemented Clone. This previously worked due to Clone
    for `[T; N]` (N in 0 to 32) being implemented for T: Copy.
    
    Due to fixed size arrays not implementing Clone for sizes above 32,
    the new implementation requiring T: Clone would not allow
    `[[u8; 256]; 4]` to be Clone.
    
    Fixes #30244
    
    Due to changing back, this is technically a [breaking-change],
    albeit for a behavior that existed for a very short time.

    Auto merge of #30043 - arielb1:split-metadata, r=nikomatsakis
    
    This improves bootstrap times because of better parallelism - though I need to measure how much - and allows metadata to be modified without triggering a full recompile. This also ensures that metadata handling and the rest of rustc remain decoupled, which is a first step for switching to a new metadata format.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] to all plugin authors because of the following renames:
     * `rustc::plugin` is now `rustc_plugin`
     * `rustc::metadata` is now `rustc_metadata`
     * Most data types from `rustc::metadata`, along with `LOCAL_CRATE`, are now in `rustc::middle::cstore`.
     * The CStore methods were split between the `rustc::middle::CrateStore` trait (and trait object) and the `rustc_metadata::cstore::CStore`, with an `Rc&lt;CrateStore&gt;` stored in the `Session`. The inner `CStore` can be accessed via the inner `Any` bound, but this is deprecated.

    Refactor the HIR so that items are stored in a map in the `Crate`,
    rather being stored inline. Refactor (and rename) the visitor so that
    (by default) it only visits the interior content of an item not nested
    items.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] for anyone who uses the HIR visitor. Besides
    changing `visit::` to `intravisit::`, you need to refactor your visitor
    in one of two ways, depending on what it requires:
    
    1. If you just want to visit all items (most common), you should call
       `krate.visit_all_items(&amp;mut visitor)`.
    
    2. If you need to visit nested items in the middle of the parent items,
       you should override `visit_nested_item` with something like:
       `self.visit_item(self.tcx.map.expect_item(item.id))`, presuming you
       have access to a tcx (or at least a HIR map).

    According to a recent [discussion on IRC](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-tools/2015-10-27/?msg=52887517&amp;page=2), there's no good reason for Windows builds to store target libraries under `bin`, when on every other platform they are under `lib`.
    
    This might be a [breaking-change] for some users.  I am pretty sure VisualRust has that path hard-coded somewhere.

    Add `Shared` pointer and have `{Arc, Rc}` use it

    1. It makes `Arc&lt;T&gt;` and `Rc&lt;T&gt;` covariant in `T`.
    
    2. It causes the compiler to reject code that was unsound with respect
    to dropck. See compile-fail/issue-29106.rs for an example of code that
    no longer compiles. Because of this, this is a [breaking-change].

    Auto merge of #28742 - nikomatsakis:def-id-encapsulate, r=eddyb
    
    As described in https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1298, the idea here is to make DefIds independent of changes to the content of other items. They are also *mostly* independent from ordering, so e.g. reordering two functions will change the defids, but it will not change the paths that they expand into (but this is not the case for some things, such as impls).
    
    This is a major refactoring, so I did it in slices. The final commit is in some sense The Big One where most of the work is done. The earlier commits just pave the way by gradually refactoring accesses to the `node` field.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] for plugin authors. The things you need to do to migrate your code are as follows:
    
    1. For local def-ids, rather than do `def_id.node`, call `tcx.map.as_local_node_id(def_id)`.
    2. To construct a local def-id, call `tcx.map.local_def_id(node_id)`.
    3. Note that you cannot make def-ids for any node, but only for "definitions" -- which include all items, as well as a number of other things, but not e.g. arbitrary expressions.
    4. You can get the path to a def-id by calling `tcx.def_path(def_id)`.
    
    One thing that is NOT part of this PR, but which I plan do in a follow-up, is converting uses of the existing `with_path` API to use `def_path`, which is basically the same.

    native libraries on the linker command line. Detail of bugs this can cause can
    be found in #28595, and this change also invalidates the test case that was
    added for #12446 which is now considered a bug because the downstream dependency
    would need to declare that it depends on the native library somehow.
    
    Closes #28595
    [breaking-change]

    Auto merge of #28538 - alevy:make_fixedsizearray_unsafe, r=alexcrichton
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    `FixedSizeArray` is meant to be implemented for arrays of fixed size only, but can be implemented for anything at the moment. Marking the trait unsafe would make it more reasonable to write unsafe code which operates on fixed size arrays of any size.
    
    For example, using `uninitialized` to create a fixed size array and immediately filling it with a fixed value is externally safe:
    
    ```
    pub fn init_with_nones&lt;T, A: FixedSizeArray&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;() -&gt; A {
        let mut res = unsafe { mem::uninitialized() };
        for elm in res.as_mut_slice().iter_mut() {
            *elm = None;
        }
        res
    }
    ```
    
    But the same code is not safe if `FixedSizeArray` is implemented for other types:
    
    ```
    struct Foo { foo: usize }
    impl FixedSizeArray&lt;Option&lt;usize&gt;&gt; for Foo {
        fn as_slice(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;[usize] { &amp;[] }
        fn as_mut_slice(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;mut [usize] { &amp;mut [] }
    }
    ```
    
    now `init_with_nones() : Foo` returns a `Foo` with an undefined value for the field `foo`.
