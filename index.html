    auto merge of #19167 : japaric/rust/rhs-cmp, r=aturon
    
    Comparison traits have gained an `Rhs` input parameter that defaults to `Self`. And now the comparison operators can be overloaded to work between different types. In particular, this PR allows the following operations (and their commutative versions):
    
    - `&str` == `String` == `CowString`
    - `&[A]` == `&mut [B]` == `Vec<C>` == `CowVec<D>` == `[E, ..N]` (for `N` up to 32)
    - `&mut A` == `&B` (for `Sized` `A` and `B`)
    
    Where `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E` may be different types that implement `PartialEq`. For example, these comparisons are now valid: `string == "foo"`, and `vec_of_strings == ["Hello", "world"]`.
    
    [breaking-change]s
    
    Since the `==` may now work on different types, operations that relied on the old "same type restriction" to drive type inference, will need to be type annotated. These are the most common fallout cases:
    
    - `some_vec == some_iter.collect()`: `collect` needs to be type annotated: `collect::<Vec<_>>()`
    - `slice == &[a, b, c]`: RHS doesn't get coerced to an slice, use an array instead `[a, b, c]`
    - `lhs == []`: Change expression to `lhs.is_empty()`
    - `lhs == some_generic_function()`: Type annotate the RHS as necessary

    std: Change the behavior of `reserve` for HashMap.
    
    HashMap's `reserve` method now takes as an argument the *extra* space
    to reserve.

    Fix the ordering of `unsafe` and `extern` in methods
    
    This breaks code that looks like this:
    
        trait Foo {
            extern "C" unsafe fn foo();
        }
    
        impl Foo for Bar {
            extern "C" unsafe fn foo() { ... }
        }
    
    Change such code to look like this:
    
        trait Foo {
            unsafe extern "C" fn foo();
        }
    
        impl Foo for Bar {
            unsafe extern "C" fn foo() { ... }
        }
    
    Fixes #19398.

    auto merge of #19176 : aturon/rust/stab-iter, r=alexcrichton
    
    This is an initial pass at stabilizing the `iter` module. The module is
    fairly large, but is also pretty polished, so most of the stabilization
    leaves things as they are.
    
    Some changes:
    
    * Due to the new object safety rules, various traits needs to be split
      into object-safe traits and extension traits. This includes `Iterator`
      itself. While splitting up the traits adds some complexity, it will
      also increase flexbility: once we have automatic impls of `Trait` for
      trait objects over `Trait`, then things like the iterator adapters
      will all work with trait objects.
    
    * Iterator adapters that use up the entire iterator now take it by
      value, which makes the semantics more clear and helps catch bugs. Due
      to the splitting of Iterator, this does not affect trait objects. If
      the underlying iterator is still desired for some reason, `by_ref` can
      be used. (Note: this change had no fallout in the Rust distro except
      for the useless mut lint.)
    
    * In general, extension traits new and old are following an [in-progress
      convention](rust-lang/rfcs#445). As such, they
      are marked `unstable`.
    
    * As usual, anything involving closures is `unstable` pending unboxed
      closures.
    
    * A few of the more esoteric/underdeveloped iterator forms (like
      `RandomAccessIterator` and `MutableDoubleEndedIterator`, along with
      various unfolds) are left experimental for now.
    
    * The `order` submodule is left `experimental` because it will hopefully
      be replaced by generalized comparison traits.
    
    * "Leaf" iterators (like `Repeat` and `Counter`) are uniformly
      constructed by free fns at the module level. That's because the types
      are not otherwise of any significance (if we had `impl Trait`, you
      wouldn't want to define a type at all).
    
    Closes #17701

    Unpublicize reexports, unprefix JSON type aliases
    
    The type aliases json::JsonString and json::JsonObject were originally
    prefixed with 'json' to prevent collisions with (at the time) the enums
    json::String and json::Object respectively. Now that enum namespacing
    has landed, this 'json' prefix is redundant and can be removed:
    
    json::JsonArray -> json::Array
    json::JsonObject -> json::Object
    
    In addition, this commit also unpublicizes all of the re-exports in this
    JSON module, as a part of #19253

    - Add `IntoCow` trait, and put it in the prelude
    - Add `is_owned`/`is_borrowed` methods to `Cow`
    - Add `CowString`/`CowVec` type aliases (to `Cow<'_, String, str>`/`Cow<'_, Vec, [T]>` respectively)
    - `Cow` implements: `Show`, `Hash`, `[Partial]{Eq,Ord}`
    - `impl BorrowFrom<Cow<'a, T, B>> for B`
    
    [breaking-change]s:
    
    - `IntoMaybeOwned` has been removed from the prelude
    - libcollections: `SendStr` is now an alias to `CowString<'static>` (it was aliased to `MaybeOwned<'static>`)
    - libgraphviz:
      - `LabelText` variants now wrap `CowString` instead of `MaybeOwned`
      - `Nodes` and `Edges` are now type aliases to `CowVec` (they were aliased to `MaybeOwnedVec`)
    - libstd/path: `Display::as_maybe_owned` has been renamed to `Display::as_cow` and now returns a `CowString`
    - These functions now accept/return `Cow` instead of `MaybeOwned[Vector]`:
      - libregex: `Replacer::reg_replace`

    Clean up FileType enum following enum namespacing
    
    All of the enum components had a redundant 'Type' specifier: TypeSymlink, TypeDirectory, TypeFile. This change removes them, replacing them with a namespace: FileType::Symlink, FileType::Directory, and FileType::RegularFile.
    
    RegularFile is used instead of just File, as File by itself could be mistakenly thought of as referring to the struct.

    This commit removes the `std::local_data` module in favor of a new `std::thread_local`
    module providing thread local storage. The module provides two variants of TLS:
    one which owns its contents and one which is based on scoped references. Each
    implementation has pros and cons listed in the documentation.
    
    Both flavors have accessors through a function called `with` which yield a
    reference to a closure provided. Both flavors also panic if a reference cannot
    be yielded and provide a function to test whether an access would panic or not.
    This is an implementation of [RFC 461][rfc] and full details can be found in
    that RFC.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the removal of the `std::local_data` module.
    All users can migrate to the new tls system like so:
    
        thread_local!(static FOO: Rc<RefCell<Option<T>>> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(None)))
    
    The old `local_data` module inherently contained the `Rc<RefCell<Option<T>>>` as

    rollup merge of #19194: aturon/stab-ascii
    
    This is an initial API stabilization pass for `std::ascii`. Aside from
    some renaming to match conversion conventions, and deprecations in favor
    of using iterators directly, almost nothing is changed here. However,
    the static case conversion tables that were previously public are now private.
    
    The stabilization of the (rather large!) set of extension traits is left
    to a follow-up pass, because we hope to land some more general machinery
    that will provide the same functionality without custom traits.

    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 240][rfc] when applied to the standard
    library. It primarily deprecates the entirety of `string::raw`, `vec::raw`,
    `slice::raw`, and `str::raw` in favor of associated functions, methods, and

    std: Align `raw` modules with unsafe conventions
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 240][rfc] when applied to the standard
    library. It primarily deprecates the entirety of `string::raw`, `vec::raw`,
    `slice::raw`, and `str::raw` in favor of associated functions, methods, and

    libs: stabilize ascii module
    
    This is an initial API stabilization pass for `std::ascii`. Aside from
    some renaming to match conversion conventions, and deprecations in favor
    of using iterators directly, almost nothing is changed here. However,
    the static case conversion tables that were previously public are now private.
    
    The stabilization of the (rather large!) set of extension traits is left
    to a follow-up pass, because we hope to land some more general machinery
    that will provide the same functionality without custom traits.

    unicode: Rename UnicodeChar::is_digit to is_numeric
    
    'Numeric' is the proper name of the unicode character class,
    and this frees up the word 'digit' for ascii use in libcore.
    
    Since I'm going to rename `Char::is_digit_radix` to
    `is_digit`, I am not leaving a deprecated method in place,
    because that would just cause name clashes, as both
    `Char` and `UnicodeChar` are in the prelude.

    auto merge of #18967 : aturon/rust/remove-runtime, r=alexcrichton
    
    This PR completes the removal of the runtime system and green-threaded abstractions as part of implementing [RFC 230](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230).
    
    Specifically:
    
    * It removes the `Runtime` trait, welding the scheduling infrastructure directly to native threads.
    
    * It removes `libgreen` and `libnative` entirely.
    
    * It rewrites `sync::mutex` as a trivial layer on top of native mutexes. Eventually, the two modules will be merged.
    
    * It hides the vast majority of `std::rt`.
    
    This completes the basic task of removing the runtime system (I/O and scheduling) and components that depend on it.
    
    After this lands, a follow-up PR will pull the `rustrt` crate back into `std`, turn `std::task` into `std::thread` (with API changes to go along with it), and completely cut out the remaining startup/teardown sequence. Other changes, including new [TLS](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/461) and synchronization are in the RFC or pre-RFC phase.

    This PR changes `AsSlice` to work on unsized types, and changes the

    This is a breaking change: code that uses generics bounded by `AsSlice`
    will have to change. In particular, such code previously often took
    arguments of type `V` where `V: AsSlice<T>` by value. These should now
    be taken by reference:

    A few std lib functions have been changed accordingly.

    * A number of formatting traits have been removed: String, Bool, Char, Unsigned,
      Signed, and Float. It is recommended to instead use Show wherever possible or
      to use adaptor structs to implement other methods of formatting.
    
    * The format specifier for Boolean has changed from `t` to `b`.
    
    * The enum `FormatError` has been renamed to `Error` as well as becoming a unit
      struct instead of an enum. The `WriteError` variant no longer exists.
    
    * The `format_args_method!` macro has been removed with no replacement. Alter
      code to use the `format_args!` macro instead.
    
    * The public fields of a `Formatter` have become read-only with no replacement.
      Use a new formatting string to alter the formatting flags in combination with
      the `write!` macro. The fields can be accessed through accessor methods on the
      `Formatter` structure.
    
    Other than these breaking changes, the contents of std::fmt should now also all
    contain stability markers. Most of them are still #[unstable] or #[experimental]

    change return type of slice_shift_char
    
    `slice_shift_char` splits a `str` into it's leading `char` and the remainder
    of the `str`. Currently, it returns a `(Option<char>, &str)` such that:
    
        "bar".slice_shift_char() => (Some('b'), "ar")
        "ar".slice_shift_char()  => (Some('a'), "r")
        "r".slice_shift_char()   => (Some('r'), "")
        "".slice_shift_char()    => (None,      "")
    
    This is a little odd. Either a `str` can be split into both a head and a
    tail or it cannot. So the return type should be `Option<(char, &str)>`.
    With the current behaviour, in the case of the empty string, the `str`
    returned is meaningless - it is always the empty string.
    
    This commit changes slice_shift_char so that:
    
        "bar".slice_shift_char() => Some(('b', "ar"))
        "ar".slice_shift_char()  => Some(('a', "r"))
        "r".slice_shift_char()   => Some(('r', ""))
        "".slice_shift_char()    => None

    Rewrite std::sync::TaskPool to be load balancing and panic-resistant
    
    The previous implementation was very likely to cause panics during
    unwinding through this process:
    
    - child panics, drops its receiver
    - taskpool comes back around and sends another job over to that child
    - the child receiver has hung up, so the taskpool panics on send
    - during unwinding, the taskpool attempts to send a quit message to
      the child, causing a panic during unwinding
    - panic during unwinding causes a process abort
    
    This meant that TaskPool upgraded any child panic to a full process
    abort. This came up in Iron when it caused crashes in long-running
    servers.
    
    This implementation uses a single channel to communicate between
    spawned tasks and the TaskPool, which significantly reduces the complexity
    of the implementation and cuts down on allocation. The TaskPool uses
    the channel as a single-producer-multiple-consumer queue.
    
    Additionally, through the use of send_opt and recv_opt instead of
    send and recv, this TaskPool is robust on the face of child panics,
    both before, during, and after the TaskPool itself is dropped.
    
    Due to the TaskPool no longer using an `init_fn_factory`, this is a
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    otherwise, the API has not changed.
    
    If you used `init_fn_factory` in your code, and this change breaks for
    you, you can instead use an `AtomicUint` counter and a channel to
    move information into child tasks.

    - `Signed::abs_sub` has been moved to `std::num::FloatMath`, and is no longer implemented for signed integers.
    - `core::num::Signed` has been removed, and its methods have been moved to `core::num::Float` and a new trait, `core::num::SignedInt`. The methods now take the `self` parameter by value.
    - `core::num::{Saturating, CheckedAdd, CheckedSub, CheckedMul, CheckedDiv}` have been removed, and their methods moved to `core::num::Int`. Their parameters are now taken by value. This means that
    - `std::time::Duration` no longer implements `core::num::{Zero, CheckedAdd, CheckedSub}` instead defining the required methods non-polymorphically.
    - `core::num::{zero, one, abs, signum}` have been deprecated. Use their respective methods instead.
    - The `core::num::{next_power_of_two, is_power_of_two, checked_next_power_of_two}` functions have been deprecated in favor of methods defined a new trait, `core::num::UnsignedInt`
    - `core::iter::{AdditiveIterator, MultiplicativeIterator}` are now only implemented for the built-in numeric types.
    - `core::iter::{range, range_inclusive, range_step, range_step_inclusive}` now require `core::num::Int` to be implemented for the type they a re parametrized over.

    auto merge of #18557 : aturon/rust/io-removal, r=alexcrichton
    
    This PR includes a sequence of commits that gradually dismantles the `librustrt` `rtio` system -- the main trait previously used to abstract over green and native io. It also largely dismantles `libnative`, moving much of its code into `libstd` and refactoring as it does so.
    
    TL;DR:
    
    * Before this PR: `rustc hello.rs && wc -c hello` produces 715,996
    * After this PR:  `rustc hello.rs && wc -c hello` produces 368,100
    
    That is, this PR reduces the footprint of hello world by ~50%.
    
    This is a major step toward #17325 (i.e. toward implementing the [runtime removal RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230).) What remains is to pull out the scheduling, synchronization and task infrastructure, and to remove `libgreen`. These will be done soon in a follow-up PR.
    
    Part of the work here is eliminating the `rtio` abstraction, which in many cases means bringing the implementation of io closer to the actual API presented in `std::io`.
    
    Another aspect of this PR is the creation of two new, *private* modules within `std` that implement io:
    
    * The `sys` module, which represents a platform-specific implementation of a number of low-level abstractions that are used directly within `std::io` and `std::os`. These "abstractions" are left largely the same as they were in `libnative` (except for the removal of `Arc` in file descriptors), but they are expected to evolve greatly over time. Organizationally, there are `sys/unix/` and `sys/windows/` directories which both implement the entire `sys` module hierarchy; this means that nearly all of the platform-specific code is isolated and you can get a handle on each platform in isolation.
    
    * The `sys_common` module, which is rooted at `sys/common`, and provides a few pieces of private, low-level, but cross-platform functionality.
    
    In the long term, the `sys` modules will provide hooks for exposing high-level platform-specific APIs as part of `libstd`. The first such API will be access to file descriptors from `std::io` abstractions, but a bit of design work remains before that step can be taken.
    
    The `sys_common` module includes some traits (like `AsFileDesc`) which allow communication of private details between modules in disparate locations in the hierarchy; this helps overcome the relatively simple hierarchical privacy system in Rust.
    
    To emphasize: the organization in `sys` is *very preliminary* and the main goal was to migrate away from `rtio` as quickly and simply as possible. The design will certainly evolve over time, and all of the details are currently private.
    
    Along the way, this PR also entirely removes signal handling, since it was only supported on `librustuv` which was removed a while ago.
    
    Because of the removal of APIs from `libnative` and `librustrt`, and the removal of signal handling, this is a:
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    Some of these APIs will return in public from from `std` over time.

    auto merge of #18556 : seanmonstar/rust/tm-fmt, r=alexcrichton
    
    The internals of strftime were converted to use a single formatter,
    instead of creating and concatenating a bunch of small strings. This
    showed ~3x improvement in the benches.
    
    Also, since the formatted time may be going straight to a Writer, TmFmt
    was introduced, and is returned from all formatting methods on Tm. This
    allows the saving of another string allocation. Anyone wanting a String
    can just call .to_string() on the returned value.
    
    This runs validation prior to return the created `TmFmt`, catching errors before formatting happens. The specialized formats skip this validation, since we already know they are valid.

    Remove rlibc from the distribution
    
    To make progress on #18585 we're paring down the distribution to theoretically
    "only libstd", and this commit makes progress on this by removing the rlibc
    crate from the distribution.
    
    The crate has now been moved into an external cargo package located in the rust
    lang organization [1]. This is a breaking change due to this removal, and
    existing crates depending on `rlibc` should use the Cargo crate instead.

    auto merge of #18486 : nikomatsakis/rust/operator-dispatch, r=pcwalton
    
    This branch cleans up overloaded operator resolution so that it is strictly based on the traits in `ops`, rather than going through the normal method lookup mechanism. It also adds full support for autoderef to overloaded index (whereas before autoderef only worked for non-overloaded index) as well as for the slicing operators.
    
    This is a [breaking-change]: in the past, we were accepting combinations of operands that were not intended to be accepted. For example, it was possible to compare a fixed-length array and a slice, or apply the `!` operator to a `&int`. See the first two commits in this pull-request for examples.
    
    One downside of this change is that comparing fixed-length arrays doesn't always work as smoothly as it did before. Before this, comparisons sometimes worked due to various coercions to slices. I've added impls for `Eq`, `Ord`, etc for fixed-lengths arrays up to and including length 32, but if the array is longer than that you'll need to either newtype the array or convert to slices. Note that this plays better with deriving in any case than the previous scheme.
    
    Fixes #4920.
    Fixes #16821.
    Fixes #15757.

    - The `BytesContainer::container_into_owned_bytes` method has been removed
    
    - Methods that used to take `BytesContainer` implementors by value, now take them by reference. In particular, this breaks some uses of Path:
    
    ``` rust
    Path::new("foo")  // Still works
    path.join(another_path) -> path.join(&another_path)
    ```

    ---
    
    Re: `container_into_owned_bytes`, I've removed it because
    
    - Nothing in the whole repository uses it
    - Takes `self` by value, which is incompatible with unsized types (`str`)
    
    The alternative to removing this method is to split `BytesContainer` into `BytesContainer for Sized?` and `SizedBytesContainer: BytesContainer + Sized`, where the second trait only contains the `container_into_owned_bytes` method. I tried this alternative [in another branch](https://github.com/japaric/rust/commits/bytes) and it works, but it seemed better not to create a new trait for an unused method.
    
    Re: Breakage of `Path` methods
    
    We could use the idea that @alexcrichton proposed in #18457 (add blanket `impl BytesContainer for &T where T: BytesContainer` + keep taking `T: BytesContainer` by value in `Path` methods) to avoid breaking any code.

    auto merge of #17595 : danburkert/rust/tuple-index-deserialization, r=alexcrichton
    
    Currently `Decoder` implementations are not provided the tuple arity as
    a parameter to `read_tuple`. This forces all encoder/decoder combos to
    serialize the arity along with the elements. Tuple-arity is always known
    statically at the decode site, because it is part of the type of the
    tuple, so it could instead be provided as an argument to `read_tuple`,
    as it is to `read_struct`.
    
    The upside to this is that serialized tuples could become smaller in
    encoder/decoder implementations which choose not to serialize type
    (arity) information. For example, @TyOverby's
    [binary-encode](https://github.com/TyOverby/binary-encode) format is
    currently forced to serialize the tuple-arity along with every tuple,
    despite the information being statically known at the decode site.
    
    A downside to this change is that the tuple-arity of serialized tuples
    can no longer be automatically checked during deserialization. However,
    for formats which do serialize the tuple-arity, either explicitly (rbml)
    or implicitly (json), this check can be added to the `read_tuple` method.
    
    The signature of `Deserialize::read_tuple` and
    `Deserialize::read_tuple_struct` are changed, and thus binary
    backwards-compatibility is broken. This change does *not* force
    serialization formats to change, and thus does not break decoding values
    serialized prior to this change.
