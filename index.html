    auto merge of #20117 : lfairy/rust/rename-include-bin, r=alexcrichton
    
    According to [RFC 344][], methods that return `&amp;[u8]` should have names ending in `bytes`. Though `include_bin!` is a macro not a method, it seems reasonable to follow the convention anyway.
    
    We keep the old name around for now, but trigger a deprecation warning when it is used.

    Rename and namespace `FPCategory`
    
    Rename `FPCategory` to `FpCategory` and `Fp* to `*` in order to adhere to the
    naming convention
    
    This is a [breaking-change].
    
    Existing code like this:
    ```
    use std::num::{FPCategory, FPNaN};
    ```
    should be adjusted to this:
    ```
    use std::num::FpCategory as Fp
    ```
    
    In the following code you can use the constants `Fp::Nan`, `Fp::Normal`, etc.

    rollup merge of #20033: alexcrichton/deprecate-serialise
    
    This commit completes the deprecation story for the in-tree serialization
    library. The compiler will now emit a warning whenever it encounters
    `deriving(Encodable)` or `deriving(Decodable)`, and the library itself is now
    marked `#[unstable]` for when feature staging is enabled.
    
    All users of serialization can migrate to the `rustc-serialize` crate on
    crates.io which provides the exact same interface as the libserialize library
    in-tree. The new deriving modes are named `RustcEncodable` and `RustcDecodable`
    and require `extern crate "rustc-serialize" as rustc_serialize` at the crate
    root in order to expand correctly.
    
    To migrate all crates, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
    
        [dependencies]
        rustc-serialize = "0.1.1"
    
    And then add the following to your crate root:
    
        extern crate "rustc-serialize" as rustc_serialize;
    
    Finally, rename `Encodable` and `Decodable` deriving modes to `RustcEncodable`
    and `RustcDecodable`.

    rollup merge of #19216: Gankro/bitv
    
    Part of #18424
    
    This commit changes the semantics of `reserve` and `capacity` for Bitv and BitvSet to match conventions. It also introduces the notion of `reserve_index` and `reserve_index_exact` for collections with maximum-index-based capacity semantics.
    
    Deprecates free function constructors in favour of functions on Bitv itself.
    
    Changes `Bitv::pop` to return an Option rather than panicking.
    
    Deprecates and renames several methods in favour of conventions.
    
    Marks several blessed methods as unstable.
    
    This commit also substantially refactors Bitv and BitvSet's implementations. The new implementation is simpler, cleaner, better documented, and more robust against overflows. It also reduces coupling between Bitv and BitvSet. Tests have been seperated into seperate submodules.

    auto merge of #19654 : aturon/rust/merge-rt, r=alexcrichton
    
    This PR substantially narrows the notion of a "runtime" in Rust, and allows calling into Rust code directly without any setup or teardown.
    
    After this PR, the basic "runtime support" in Rust will consist of:
    
    * Unwinding and backtrace support
    * Stack guards
    
    Other support, such as helper threads for timers or the notion of a "current thread" are initialized automatically upon first use.
    
    When using Rust in an embedded context, it should now be possible to call a Rust function directly as a C function with absolutely no setup, though in that case panics will cause the process to abort. In this regard, the C/Rust interface will look much like the C/C++ interface.
    
    In more detail, this PR:
    
    * Merges `librustrt` back into `std::rt`, undoing the facade. While doing so, it removes a substantial amount of redundant functionality (such as mutexes defined in the `rt` module). Code using `librustrt` can now call into `std::rt` to e.g. start executing Rust code with unwinding support.
    
    * Allows all runtime data to be initialized lazily, including the "current thread", the "at_exit" infrastructure, and the "args" storage.
    
    * Deprecates and largely removes `std::task` along with the widespread requirement that there be a "current task" for many APIs in `std`. The entire task infrastructure is replaced with `std::thread`, which provides a more standard API for manipulating and creating native OS threads. In particular, it's possible to join on a created thread, and to get a handle to the currently-running thread. In addition, threads are equipped with some basic blocking support in the form of `park`/`unpark` operations (following a tradition in some OSes as well as the JVM). See the `std::thread` documentation for more details.
    
    * Channels are refactored to use a new internal blocking infrastructure that itself sits on top of `park`/`unpark`.
    
    One important change here is that a Rust program ends when its main thread does, following most threading models. On the other hand, threads will often be created with an RAII-style join handle that will re-institute blocking semantics naturally (and with finer control).
    
    This is very much a:

    Disable at_exit handlers
    
    The [final step](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/19654) of
    runtime removal changes the threading/process model so that the process
    shuts down when the main thread exits. But several shared resources,
    like the helper thread for timeouts, are shut down when the main thread
    exits (but before the process ends), and they are not prepared to be
    used after shut down, but other threads may try to access them during
    the shutdown sequence of the main thread.
    
    As an interim solution, the `at_exit` cleanup routine is simply skipped.
    
    Ultimately, these resources should be made to safely handle asynchronous
    shutdown, usually by panicking if called from a detached thread when the
    main thread is ending.
    
    See issue for details https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20012
    
    This is a [breaking-change] for anyone relying on `at_exit`.

    Revise std::thread API to join by default
    
    This commit is part of a series that introduces a `std::thread` API to
    replace `std::task`.
    
    In the new API, `spawn` returns a `JoinGuard`, which by default will
    join the spawned thread when dropped. It can also be used to join
    explicitly at any time, returning the thread's result. Alternatively,
    the spawned thread can be explicitly detached (so no join takes place).
    
    As part of this change, Rust processes now terminate when the main
    thread exits, even if other detached threads are still running, moving
    Rust closer to standard threading models. This new behavior may break code
    that was relying on the previously implicit join-all.
    
    In addition to the above, the new thread API also offers some built-in
    support for building blocking abstractions in user space; see the module
    doc for details.
    
    Closes #18000

    Remove rt::bookkeeping
    
    This commit removes the runtime bookkeeping previously used to ensure
    that all Rust tasks were joined before the runtime was shut down.
    
    This functionality will be replaced by an RAII style `Thread` API, that
    will also offer a detached mode.

    libs: merge librustrt into libstd
    
    This commit merges the `rustrt` crate into `std`, undoing part of the
    facade. This merger continues the paring down of the runtime system.
    
    Code relying on the public API of `rustrt` will break; some of this API
    is now available through `std::rt`, but is likely to change and/or be
    removed very soon.

    All of these collections have already been moved to collect-rs where they will ideally be maintained and experimented with, or will be replaced by something better: https://github.com/Gankro/collect-rs/

    rollup merge of #19818: emk/regex_at_name_opt
    
    Hello! This is my first Rust patch, and I fear that I've probably skipped at least 7 critical steps. I'd appreciate your feedback and advice about how to contribute to Rust.
    
    This patch is based on a discussion with @BurntSushi in #14602 a while back. I'm happy to revise it as needed to fit into the modern world. :-)
    
    As discussed in that issue, the existing `at` and `name` functions represent two different results with the empty string:
    
    1. Matched the empty string.
    2. Did not match anything.
    
    Consider the following example.  This regex has two named matched groups, `key` and `value`. `value` is optional:
    
    ```rust
    // Matches "foo", "foo;v=bar" and "foo;v=".
    regex!(r"(?P&lt;key&gt;[a-z]+)(;v=(?P&lt;value&gt;[a-z]*))?");
    ```
    
    We can access `value` using `caps.name("value")`, but there's no way for us to distinguish between the `"foo"` and `"foo;v="` cases.
    
    Early this year, @BurntSushi recommended modifying the existing `at` and `name` functions to return `Option`, instead of adding new functions to the API.
    
    This is a [breaking-change], but the fix is easy:
    
    - `refs.at(1)` becomes `refs.at(1).unwrap_or("")`.
    - `refs.name(name)` becomes `refs.name(name).unwrap_or("")`.

    - The following operator traits now take their arguments by value: `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, `Div`, `Rem`, `BitAnd`, `BitOr`, `BitXor`, `Shl`, `Shr`. This breaks all existing implementations of these traits.
    
    - The binary operation `a OP b` now "desugars" to `OpTrait::op_method(a, b)` and consumes both arguments.
    
    - `String` and `Vec` addition have been changed to reuse the LHS owned value, and to avoid internal cloning. Only the following asymmetric operations are available: `String + &amp;str` and `Vec&lt;T&gt; + &amp;[T]`, which are now a short-hand for the "append" operation.

    This passes `make check` locally. I haven't touch the unary operators in this PR, but converting them to by value should be very similar to this PR. I can work on them after this gets the thumbs up.
    
    @nikomatsakis r? the compiler changes
    @aturon r? the library changes. I think the only controversial bit is the semantic change of the `Vec`/`String` `Add` implementation.

    some more flavorful variants of decoders which may need to run the closure more
    than once when it, for example, attempts to find the first successful enum to

    This a breaking change due to the bounds for the trait switching, and clients
    will need to update from `FnOnce` to `FnMut` as well as likely making the local

    Emit warning when lifetime names are shadowed.
    
    This is not technically a [breaking-change], but it will be soon, so
    you should update your code. Typically, shadowing is accidental, and
    the shadowing lifetime can simply be removed. This frequently occurs
    in constructor patterns:
    
    ```rust
    // Old:
    impl&lt;'a&gt; SomeStruct&lt;'a&gt; { fn new&lt;'a&gt;(..) -&gt; SomeStruct&lt;'a&gt; { ... } }
    
    // Should be:
    impl&lt;'a&gt; SomeStruct&lt;'a&gt; { fn new(..) -&gt; SomeStruct&lt;'a&gt; { ... } }
    ```
    
    Otherwise, you should rename the inner lifetime to something
    else. Note though that lifetime elision frequently applies:
    
    ```rust
    // Old
    impl&lt;'a&gt; SomeStruct&lt;'a&gt; {
        fn get&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a self) -&gt; &amp;'a T { &amp;self.field }
    }
    
    // Should be:
    impl&lt;'a&gt; SomeStruct&lt;'a&gt; {
        fn get(x: &amp;self) -&gt; &amp;T { &amp;self.field }
    }

    auto merge of #19467 : japaric/rust/uc, r=alexcrichton
    
    This PR moves almost all our current uses of closures, both in public API and internal uses, to the new "unboxed" closures system.
    
    In most cases, downstream code that *only uses* closures will continue to work as it is. The reason is that the `|| {}` syntax can be inferred either as a boxed or an "unboxed" closure according to the context. For example the following code will continue to work:
    
    ``` rust
    some_option.map(|x| x.transform_with(upvar))
    ```
    
    And will get silently upgraded to an "unboxed" closure.
    
    In some other cases, it may be necessary to "annotate" which `Fn*` trait the closure implements:
    
    ```
    // Change this
    |x| { /* body */}
    // to either of these
    |: x| { /* body */}  // closure implements the FnOnce trait
    |&amp;mut : x| { /* body */}  // FnMut
    |&amp;: x| { /* body */}  // Fn
    ```
    
    This mainly occurs when the closure is assigned to a variable first, and then passed to a function/method.
    
    ``` rust
    let closure = |: x| x.transform_with(upvar);
    some.option.map(closure)
    ```
    
    (It's very likely that in the future, an improved inference engine will make this annotation unnecessary)
    
    Other cases that require annotation are closures that implement some trait via a blanket `impl`, for example:
    
    - `std::finally::Finally`
    - `regex::Replacer`
    - `std::str::CharEq`
    
    ``` rust
    string.trim_left_chars(|c: char| c.is_whitespace())
    //~^ ERROR: the trait `Fn&lt;(char,), bool&gt;` is not implemented for the type `|char| -&gt; bool`
    string.trim_left_chars(|&amp;: c: char| c.is_whitespace())  // OK
    ```
    
    Finally, all implementations of traits that contain boxed closures in the arguments of their methods are now broken. And will need to be updated to use unboxed closures. These are the main affected traits:
    
    - `serialize::Decoder`
    - `serialize::DecoderHelpers`
    - `serialize::Encoder`
    - `serialize::EncoderHelpers`
    - `rustrt::ToCStr`
    
    For example, change this:
    
    ``` rust
    // libserialize/json.rs
    impl&lt;'a&gt; Encoder&lt;io::IoError&gt; for Encoder&lt;'a&gt; {
        fn emit_enum(&amp;mut self,
                     _name: &amp;str,
                     f: |&amp;mut Encoder&lt;'a&gt;| -&gt; EncodeResult) -&gt; EncodeResult {
            f(self)
        }
    }
    ```
    
    to:
    
    ``` rust
    // libserialize/json.rs
    impl&lt;'a&gt; Encoder&lt;io::IoError&gt; for Encoder&lt;'a&gt; {
        fn emit_enum&lt;F&gt;(&amp;mut self, _name: &amp;str, f: F) -&gt; EncodeResult where
            F: FnOnce(&amp;mut Encoder&lt;'a&gt;) -&gt; EncodeResult
        {
            f(self)
        }
    }
    ```

    ### How the `Fn*` bound has been selected
    
    I've chosen the bounds to make the functions/structs as "generic as possible", i.e. to let them allow the maximum amount of input.
    
    - An `F: FnOnce` bound accepts the three kinds of closures: `|:|`, `|&amp;mut:|` and `|&amp;:|`.
    - An `F: FnMut` bound only accepts "non-consuming" closures: `|&amp;mut:|` and `|&amp;:|`.
    - An `F: Fn` bound only accept the "immutable environment" closures: `|&amp;:|`.
    
    This means that whenever possible the `FnOnce` bound has been used, if the `FnOnce` bound couldn't be used, then the `FnMut` was used. The `Fn` bound was never used in the whole repository.
    
    The `FnMut` bound was the most used, because it resembles the semantics of the current boxed closures: the closure can modify its environment, and the closure may be called several times.
    
    The `FnOnce` bound allows new semantics: you can move out the upvars when the closure is called. This can be effectively paired with the `move || {}` syntax to transfer ownership from the environment to the closure caller.
    
    In the case of trait methods, is hard to select the "right" bound since we can't control how the trait may be implemented by downstream users. In these cases, I have selected the bound based on how we use these traits in the repository. For this reason the selected bounds may not be ideal, and may require tweaking before stabilization.

    librustc: Make `Copy` opt-in.
    
    This change makes the compiler no longer infer whether types (structures
    and enumerations) implement the `Copy` trait (and thus are implicitly
    copyable). Rather, you must implement `Copy` yourself via `impl Copy for
    MyType {}`.
    
    A new warning has been added, `missing_copy_implementations`, to warn
    you if a non-generic public type has been added that could have
    implemented `Copy` but didn't.
    
    For convenience, you may *temporarily* opt out of this behavior by using
    `#![feature(opt_out_copy)]`. Note though that this feature gate will never be
    accepted and will be removed by the time that 1.0 is released, so you should
    transition your code away from using it.
    
    This breaks code like:
    
        #[deriving(Show)]
        struct Point2D {
            x: int,
            y: int,
        }
    
        fn main() {
            let mypoint = Point2D {
                x: 1,
                y: 1,
            };
            let otherpoint = mypoint;
            println!("{}{}", mypoint, otherpoint);
        }
    
    Change this code to:
    
        #[deriving(Show)]
        struct Point2D {
            x: int,
            y: int,
        }
    
        impl Copy for Point2D {}
    
        fn main() {
            let mypoint = Point2D {
                x: 1,
                y: 1,
            };
            let otherpoint = mypoint;

    libserialize: Always use a decimal point when emitting a float value
    
    JSON doesn't distinguish between integer and float. They are just
    numbers. Also, in the current implementation, a fractional number
    without the fractional part is encoded without a decimal point.
    
    Thereforce, when the value is decoded, it is first rendered as Json,
    either I64 or U64. This reduces type safety, because while the original
    intention was to cast the value to float, it can also be casted to
    integer.
    
    As a workaround of this problem, this commit makes the encoder always
    emit a decimal point even if it is not necessary. If the fractional part
    of a float number is zero, ".0" is padded to the end of the result.

    libserialize: Do not coerce to integer when decoding a float value
    
    When an integral value is expected by the user but a fractional value is
    found, the current implementation uses std::num::cast() to coerce to an
    integer type, losing the fractional part. This behavior is not desirable
    because the number loses precision without notice.
    
    This commit makes it raise ExpectedError when such a situation arises.

    libserialize: Remove float preprocessing in serialize::json::Encoder
    
    serialize::json::Encoder currently uses f64 to emit any integral type.
    This is possibly due to the behavior of JavaScript, which uses f64 to
    represent any numeric value.
    
    This leads to a problem that only the integers in the range of [-2^53+1,
    2^53-1] can be encoded. Therefore, i64 and u64 cannot be used reliably
    in the current implementation.
    
    RFC 7159 suggests that good interoperability can be achieved if the
    range is respected by implementations. However, it also says that
    implementations are allowed to set the range of number accepted. And it
    seems that the JSON encoders outside of the JavaScript world usually
    make use of i64 values.
    
    This commit removes the float preprocessing done in the emit_* methods.
    It also increases performance, because transforming f64 into String
    costs more than that of an integral type.
    
    Fixes #18319

    rollup merge of #19416: sfackler/global-stdin
    
    io::stdin returns a new `BufferedReader` each time it's called, which
    results in some very confusing behavior with disappearing output. It now
    returns a `StdinReader`, which wraps a global singleton
    `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;BufferedReader&lt;StdReader&gt;&gt;`. `Reader` is implemented directly
    on `StdinReader`. However, `Buffer` is not, as the `fill_buf` method is
    fundamentaly un-thread safe. A `lock` method is defined on `StdinReader`
    which returns a smart pointer wrapping the underlying `BufferedReader`
    while guaranteeing mutual exclusion.
    
    Code that treats the return value of io::stdin as implementing `Buffer`
    will break. Add a call to `lock`:
    
    ```rust
    io::stdin().read_line();
    // =&gt;
    io::stdin().lock().read_line();

    rollup merge of #19274: alexcrichton/rewrite-sync
    
    This commit is a reimplementation of `std::sync` to be based on the
    system-provided primitives wherever possible. The previous implementation was
    fundamentally built on top of channels, and as part of the runtime reform it has
    become clear that this is not the level of abstraction that the standard level
    should be providing. This rewrite aims to provide as thin of a shim as possible
    on top of the system primitives in order to make them safe.
    
    The overall interface of the `std::sync` module has in general not changed, but
    there are a few important distinctions, highlighted below:
    
    * The condition variable type, `Condvar`, has been separated out of a `Mutex`.
      A condition variable is now an entirely separate type. This separation
      benefits users who only use one mutex, and provides a clearer distinction of
      who's responsible for managing condition variables (the application).
    
    * All of `Condvar`, `Mutex`, and `RWLock` are now directly built on top of
      system primitives rather than using a custom implementation. The `Once`,
      `Barrier`, and `Semaphore` types are still built upon these abstractions of
      the system primitives.
    
    * The `Condvar`, `Mutex`, and `RWLock` types all have a new static type and
      constant initializer corresponding to them. These are provided primarily for C
      FFI interoperation, but are often useful to otherwise simply have a global
      lock. The types, however, will leak memory unless `destroy()` is called on
      them, which is clearly documented.
    
    * The fundamental architecture of this design is to provide two separate layers.
      The first layer is that exposed by `sys_common` which is a cross-platform
      bare-metal abstraction of the system synchronization primitives. No attempt is
      made at making this layer safe, and it is quite unsafe to use! It is currently
      not exported as part of the API of the standard library, but the stabilization
      of the `sys` module will ensure that these will be exposed in time. The
      purpose of this layer is to provide the core cross-platform abstractions if
      necessary to implementors.
    
      The second layer is the layer provided by `std::sync` which is intended to be
      the thinnest possible layer on top of `sys_common` which is entirely safe to
      use. There are a few concerns which need to be addressed when making these
      system primitives safe:
    
        * Once used, the OS primitives can never be **moved**. This means that they
          essentially need to have a stable address. The static primitives use
          `&amp;'static self` to enforce this, and the non-static primitives all use a
          `Box` to provide this guarantee.
    
        * Poisoning is leveraged to ensure that invalid data is not accessible from
          other tasks after one has panicked.
    
      In addition to these overall blanket safety limitations, each primitive has a
      few restrictions of its own:
    
        * Mutexes and rwlocks can only be unlocked from the same thread that they
          were locked by. This is achieved through RAII lock guards which cannot be
          sent across threads.
    
        * Mutexes and rwlocks can only be unlocked if they were previously locked.
          This is achieved by not exposing an unlocking method.
    
        * A condition variable can only be waited on with a locked mutex. This is
          achieved by requiring a `MutexGuard` in the `wait()` method.
    
        * A condition variable cannot be used concurrently with more than one mutex.
          This is guaranteed by dynamically binding a condition variable to
          precisely one mutex for its entire lifecycle. This restriction may be able
          to be relaxed in the future (a mutex is unbound when no threads are
          waiting on the condvar), but for now it is sufficient to guarantee safety.
    
    * Condvars support timeouts for their blocking operations. The
      implementation for these operations is provided by the system.
    
    Due to the modification of the `Condvar` API, removal of the `std::sync::mutex`
    API, and reimplementation, this is a breaking change. Most code should be fairly
    easy to port using the examples in the documentation of these primitives.

      bare-metal abstraction of the system synchronization primitives. No attempt is
      made at making this layer safe, and it is quite unsafe to use! It is currently
      not exported as part of the API of the standard library, but the stabilization
      of the `sys` module will ensure that these will be exposed in time. The
      purpose of this layer is to provide the core cross-platform abstractions if
      necessary to implementors.
    
      The second layer is the layer provided by `std::sync` which is intended to be
      the thinnest possible layer on top of `sys_common` which is entirely safe to
      use. There are a few concerns which need to be addressed when making these
      system primitives safe:
    
        * Once used, the OS primitives can never be **moved**. This means that they
          essentially need to have a stable address. The static primitives use
          `&amp;'static self` to enforce this, and the non-static primitives all use a
          `Box` to provide this guarantee.
    
        * Poisoning is leveraged to ensure that invalid data is not accessible from
          other tasks after one has panicked.
    
      In addition to these overall blanket safety limitations, each primitive has a
      few restrictions of its own:
    
        * Mutexes and rwlocks can only be unlocked from the same thread that they
          were locked by. This is achieved through RAII lock guards which cannot be
          sent across threads.
    
        * Mutexes and rwlocks can only be unlocked if they were previously locked.
          This is achieved by not exposing an unlocking method.
    
        * A condition variable can only be waited on with a locked mutex. This is
          achieved by requiring a `MutexGuard` in the `wait()` method.
    
        * A condition variable cannot be used concurrently with more than one mutex.
          This is guaranteed by dynamically binding a condition variable to
          precisely one mutex for its entire lifecycle. This restriction may be able
          to be relaxed in the future (a mutex is unbound when no threads are
          waiting on the condvar), but for now it is sufficient to guarantee safety.
    
    * Condvars now support timeouts for their blocking operations. The
      implementation for these operations is provided by the system.
    
    Due to the modification of the `Condvar` API, removal of the `std::sync::mutex`
    API, and reimplementation, this is a breaking change. Most code should be fairly
    easy to port using the examples in the documentation of these primitives.

    auto merge of #19167 : japaric/rust/rhs-cmp, r=aturon
    
    Comparison traits have gained an `Rhs` input parameter that defaults to `Self`. And now the comparison operators can be overloaded to work between different types. In particular, this PR allows the following operations (and their commutative versions):
    
    - `&amp;str` == `String` == `CowString`
    - `&amp;[A]` == `&amp;mut [B]` == `Vec&lt;C&gt;` == `CowVec&lt;D&gt;` == `[E, ..N]` (for `N` up to 32)
    - `&amp;mut A` == `&amp;B` (for `Sized` `A` and `B`)
    
    Where `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E` may be different types that implement `PartialEq`. For example, these comparisons are now valid: `string == "foo"`, and `vec_of_strings == ["Hello", "world"]`.
    
    [breaking-change]s
    
    Since the `==` may now work on different types, operations that relied on the old "same type restriction" to drive type inference, will need to be type annotated. These are the most common fallout cases:
    
    - `some_vec == some_iter.collect()`: `collect` needs to be type annotated: `collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;()`
    - `slice == &amp;[a, b, c]`: RHS doesn't get coerced to an slice, use an array instead `[a, b, c]`
    - `lhs == []`: Change expression to `lhs.is_empty()`
    - `lhs == some_generic_function()`: Type annotate the RHS as necessary

    Back io::stdin with a global singleton BufferedReader
    
    io::stdin returns a new `BufferedReader` each time it's called, which
    results in some very confusing behavior with disappearing output. It now
    returns a `StdinReader`, which wraps a global singleton
    `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;BufferedReader&lt;StdReader&gt;&gt;`. `Reader` is implemented directly
    on `StdinReader`. However, `Buffer` is not, as the `fill_buf` method is
    fundamentaly un-thread safe. A `lock` method is defined on `StdinReader`
    which returns a smart pointer wrapping the underlying `BufferedReader`
    while guaranteeing mutual exclusion.
    
    Code that treats the return value of io::stdin as implementing `Buffer`
    will break. Add a call to `lock`:
    
    ```rust
    io::stdin().lines()
    // =&gt;
    io::stdin().lock().lines()
    ```

    This is an initial pass at stabilizing the `iter` module. The module is
    fairly large, but is also pretty polished, so most of the stabilization
    leaves things as they are.
    
    Some changes:
    
    * Due to the new object safety rules, various traits needs to be split
      into object-safe traits and extension traits. This includes `Iterator`
      itself. While splitting up the traits adds some complexity, it will
      also increase flexbility: once we have automatic impls of `Trait` for
      trait objects over `Trait`, then things like the iterator adapters
      will all work with trait objects.
    
    * Iterator adapters that use up the entire iterator now take it by
      value, which makes the semantics more clear and helps catch bugs. Due
      to the splitting of Iterator, this does not affect trait objects. If
      the underlying iterator is still desired for some reason, `by_ref` can
      be used. (Note: this change had no fallout in the Rust distro except
      for the useless mut lint.)
    
    * In general, extension traits new and old are following an [in-progress
      convention](rust-lang/rfcs#445). As such, they
      are marked `unstable`.
    
    * As usual, anything involving closures is `unstable` pending unboxed
      closures.
    
    * A few of the more esoteric/underdeveloped iterator forms (like
      `RandomAccessIterator` and `MutableDoubleEndedIterator`, along with
      various unfolds) are left experimental for now.
    
    * The `order` submodule is left `experimental` because it will hopefully
      be replaced by generalized comparison traits.
    
    * "Leaf" iterators (like `Repeat` and `Counter`) are uniformly
      constructed by free fns at the module level. That's because the types
      are not otherwise of any significance (if we had `impl Trait`, you
      wouldn't want to define a type at all).

    Rename unwrap functions to into_inner
    
    This change applies the conventions to unwrap listed in [RFC 430][rfc] to rename
    non-failing `unwrap` methods to `into_inner`. This is a breaking change, but all
    `unwrap` methods are retained as `#[deprecated]` for the near future. To update
    code rename `unwrap` method calls to `into_inner`.

    rollup merge of #19194: aturon/stab-ascii
    
    This is an initial API stabilization pass for `std::ascii`. Aside from
    some renaming to match conversion conventions, and deprecations in favor
    of using iterators directly, almost nothing is changed here. However,
    the static case conversion tables that were previously public are now private.
    
    The stabilization of the (rather large!) set of extension traits is left

    unicode: Rename UnicodeChar::is_digit to is_numeric
    
    'Numeric' is the proper name of the unicode character class,
    and this frees up the word 'digit' for ascii use in libcore.
    
    Since I'm going to rename `Char::is_digit_radix` to
    `is_digit`, I am not leaving a deprecated method in place,
    because that would just cause name clashes, as both
    `Char` and `UnicodeChar` are in the prelude.

    auto merge of #18967 : aturon/rust/remove-runtime, r=alexcrichton
    
    This PR completes the removal of the runtime system and green-threaded abstractions as part of implementing [RFC 230](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230).
    
    Specifically:
    
    * It removes the `Runtime` trait, welding the scheduling infrastructure directly to native threads.
    
    * It removes `libgreen` and `libnative` entirely.
    
    * It rewrites `sync::mutex` as a trivial layer on top of native mutexes. Eventually, the two modules will be merged.
    
    * It hides the vast majority of `std::rt`.
    
    This completes the basic task of removing the runtime system (I/O and scheduling) and components that depend on it.
    
    After this lands, a follow-up PR will pull the `rustrt` crate back into `std`, turn `std::task` into `std::thread` (with API changes to go along with it), and completely cut out the remaining startup/teardown sequence. Other changes, including new [TLS](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/461) and synchronization are in the RFC or pre-RFC phase.

    Make most of std::rt private
    
    Previously, the entire runtime API surface was publicly exposed, but
    that is neither necessary nor desirable. This commit hides most of the
    module, using librustrt directly as needed. The arrangement will need to
    be revisited when rustrt is pulled into std.

    auto merge of #18638 : aturon/rust/as_slice_dst, r=japaric
    
    This PR changes `AsSlice` to work on unsized types, and changes the
    `impl` for `&amp;[T]` to `[T]`. Aside from making the trait more general,
    this also helps some ongoing work with method resolution changes.
    
    This is a breaking change: code that uses generics bounded by `AsSlice`
    will have to change. In particular, such code previously often took
    arguments of type `V` where `V: AsSlice&lt;T&gt;` by value. These should now
    be taken by reference:
    
    ```rust
    fn foo&lt;Sized? V: AsSlice&lt;T&gt;&gt;(v: &amp;V) { .. }
    ```
    
    A few std lib functions have been changed accordingly.
    
    The PR also relaxes constraints on generics and traits within the
    `core::ops` module and for the `Equiv` trait.
