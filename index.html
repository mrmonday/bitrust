    Auto merge of #25387 - eddyb:syn-file-loader, r=nikomatsakis
    
    This allows compiling entire crates from memory or preprocessing source files before they are tokenized.
    
    Minor API refactoring included, which is a [breaking-change] for libsyntax users:
    * `ParseSess::{next_node_id, reserve_node_ids}` moved to rustc's `Session`
    * `new_parse_sess` -&gt; `ParseSess::new`
    * `new_parse_sess_special_handler` -&gt; `ParseSess::with_span_handler`
    * `mk_span_handler` -&gt; `SpanHandler::new`
    * `default_handler` -&gt; `Handler::new`
    * `mk_handler` -&gt; `Handler::with_emitter`
    * `string_to_filemap(sess source, path)` -&gt; `sess.codemap().new_filemap(path, source)`

    Auto merge of #24612 - lifthrasiir:flt2dec, r=pnkfelix
    
    This is a direct port of my prior work on the float formatting. The detailed description is available [here](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-strconv#flt2dec). In brief,
    
    * This adds a new hidden module `core::num::flt2dec` for testing from `libcoretest`. Why is it in `core::num` instead of `core::fmt`? Because I envision that the table used by `flt2dec` is directly applicable to `dec2flt` (cf. #24557) as well, which exceeds the realm of "formatting".
    * This contains both Dragon4 algorithm (exact, complete but slow) and Grisu3 algorithm (exact, fast but incomplete).
    * The code is accompanied with a large amount of self-tests and some exhaustive tests. In particular, `libcoretest` gets a new dependency on `librand`. For the external interface it relies on the existing test suite.
    * It is known that, in the best case, the entire formatting code has about 30 KBs of binary overhead (judged from strconv experiments). Not too bad but there might be a potential room for improvements.
    
    This is rather large code. I did my best to comment and annotate the code, but you have been warned.
    
    For the maximal availability the original code was licensed in CC0, but I've also dual-licensed it in MIT/Apache as well so there should be no licensing concern.
    
    This is [breaking-change] as it changes the float output slightly (and it also affects the casing of `inf` and `nan`). I hope this is not a big deal though :)
    
    Fixes #7030, #18038 and #24556. Also related to #6220 and #20870.
    
    ## Known Issues
    
    - [x] I've yet to finish `make check-stage1`. It does pass main test suites including `run-pass` but there might be some unknown edges on the doctests.
    - [ ] Figure out how this PR affects rustc.
    - [ ] Determine which internal routine is mapped to the formatting specifier. Depending on the decision, some internal routine can be safely removed (for instance, currently `to_shortest_str` is unused).

    Auto merge of #25212 - pnkfelix:dropck-box-trait, r=nikomatsakis
    
    dropck: must assume `Box&lt;Trait + 'a&gt;` has a destructor of interest.
    
    Fix #25199.
    
    This detail was documented in [RFC 769]; the implementation was just missing.
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    The breakage here falls into both obvious and non-obvious cases.
    
    The obvious case: if you were relying on the unsoundness this exposes (namely being able to reference dead storage from a destructor, by doing it via a boxed trait object bounded by the lifetime of the dead storage), then this change disallows that.
    
    The non-obvious cases: The way dropck works, it causes lifetimes to be extended to longer extents than they covered before. I.e.  lifetimes that are attached as trait-bounds may become longer than they were previously.
    
    * This includes lifetimes that are only *implicitly* attached as trait-bounds (due to [RFC 599]). So you may have code that was e.g. taking a parameter of type `&amp;'a Box&lt;Trait&gt;` (which expands to `&amp;'a Box&lt;Trait+'a&gt;`), that now may need to be assigned type `&amp;'a Box&lt;Trait+'static&gt;` to ensure that `'a` is not inadvertantly inferred to a region that is actually too long.  (See commit ee06263 for an example of this.)

    Implements this (previously overlooked) note from [RFC 769]:
    
    &gt; (Note: When encountering a D of the form `Box&lt;Trait+'b&gt;`, we
    &gt; conservatively assume that such a type has a Drop implementation
    &gt; parametric in 'b.)

    Ideally this trait implementation would be unstable, requiring crates to opt-in
    if they would like the functionality, but that's not currently how stability
    works so the implementation needs to be removed entirely.
    
    This may come back at a future date, but for now the conservative option is to
    remove it.

    lint: deny transmuting from immutable to mutable, since it's undefined behavior
    
    [breaking-change] Technically breaking, since code that had been using
    these transmutes before will no longer compile. However, it was
    undefined behavior, so really, it's a good thing. Fixing your code would
    require some re-working to use an UnsafeCell instead.

    As pointed out in #17136 the semantics of a `BufStream` aren't always what one

    buffered stream with only one underlying buffer. For now this commit
    destabilizes the primitive in the `std::io` module to give us some more time in
    figuring out what to do with it.

    Auto merge of #25006 - alexcrichton:unstable-indexing, r=aturon
    
    These implementations were intended to be unstable, but currently the stability
    attributes cannot handle a stable trait with an unstable `impl` block. This
    commit also audits the rest of the standard library for explicitly-`#[unstable]`
    impl blocks. No others were removed but some annotations were changed to
    `#[stable]` as they're defacto stable anyway.
    
    One particularly interesting `impl` marked `#[stable]` as part of this commit
    is the `Add&lt;&amp;[T]&gt;` impl for `Vec&lt;T&gt;`, which uses `push_all` and implicitly
    clones all elements of the vector provided.

    Auto merge of #24793 - aturon:io-error-any, r=alexcrichton
    
    This commit brings the `Error` trait in line with the [Error interoperation
    RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/201) by adding downcasting,
    which has long been intended. This change means that for any `Error`
    trait objects that are `'static`, you can downcast to concrete error
    types.
    
    To make this work, it is necessary for `Error` to inherit from
    `Reflect` (which is currently used to mark concrete types as "permitted
    for reflection, aka downcasting"). This is a breaking change: it means
    that impls like
    
    ```rust
    impl&lt;T&gt; Error for MyErrorType&lt;T&gt; { ... }
    ```
    
    must change to
    
    ```rust
    impl&lt;T: Reflect&gt; Error for MyErrorType&lt;T&gt; { ... }
    ```
    
    This commit furthermore marks `Reflect` as stable, since we are already
    essentially committed to it via `Any`. Note that in the future, if we
    determine that the parametricity aspects of `Reflect` are not needed, we
    can deprecate the trait and provide a blanket implementation for it
    for *all* types (rather than by using OIBIT), which would allow all
    mentions of `Reflect` to be dropped over time. So there is not a strong
    commitment here.

    Add downcasting to std::error::Error
    
    This commit brings the `Error` trait in line with the [Error interoperation
    RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/201) by adding downcasting,
    which has long been intended. This change means that for any `Error`
    trait objects that are `'static`, you can downcast to concrete error
    types.
    
    To make this work, it is necessary for `Error` to inherit from
    `Reflect` (which is currently used to mark concrete types as "permitted
    for reflection, aka downcasting"). This is a breaking change: it means
    that impls like
    
    ```rust
    impl&lt;T&gt; Error for MyErrorType&lt;T&gt; { ... }
    ```
    
    must change to something like
    
    ```rust
    impl&lt;T: Reflect&gt; Error for MyErrorType&lt;T&gt; { ... }
    ```
    
    except that `Reflect` is currently unstable (and should remain so for
    the time being). For now, code can instead bound by `Any`:
    
    ```rust
    impl&lt;T: Any&gt; Error for MyErrorType&lt;T&gt; { ... }
    ```
    
    which *is* stable and has `Reflect` as a super trait. The downside is
    that this imposes a `'static` constraint, but that only
    constrains *when* `Error` is implemented -- it does not actually
    constrain the types that can implement `Error`.

    Auto merge of #24765 - pnkfelix:fsk-enum-swapindrop, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Inspect enum discriminant *after* calling its destructor
    
    Includes some drive-by cleanup (e.g. changed some field and method names to reflect fill-on-drop; added comments about zero-variant enums being classified as `_match::Single`).
    
    Probably the most invasive change was the expansion of the maps `available_drop_glues` and `drop_glues` to now hold two different kinds of drop glues; there is the (old) normal drop glue, and there is (new) drop-contents glue that jumps straight to dropping the contents of a struct or enum, skipping its destructor.
    
     * For all types that do not have user-defined Drop implementations, the normal glue is generated as usual (i.e. recursively dropping the fields of the data structure).
    
      (And this actually is exactly what the newly-added drop-contents glue does as well.)
    
     * For types that have user-defined Drop implementations, the "normal" drop glue now schedules a cleanup before invoking the `Drop::drop` method that will call the drop-contents glue after that invocation returns.
    
    Fix #23611.
    
    ----
    
    Is this a breaking change?  The prior behavior was totally unsound, and it seems unreasonable that anyone was actually relying on it.
    
    Nonetheless, since there is a user-visible change to the language semantics, I guess I will conservatively mark this as a:
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    (To see an example of what sort of user-visible change this causes, see the comments in the regression test.)

    Auto merge of #23085 - goffrie:interpolating-quote, r=huonw
    
    This changes the `ToTokens` implementations for expressions, statements, etc. with almost-trivial ones that produce `Interpolated(*Nt(...))` pseudo-tokens. In this way, quasiquote now works the same way as macros do: already-parsed AST fragments are used as-is, not reparsed.
    
    The `ToSource` trait is removed. Quasiquote no longer involves pretty-printing at all, which removes the need for the `encode_with_hygiene` hack. All associated machinery is removed.
    
    New `Nonterminal`s are added: NtArm, NtImplItem, and NtTraitItem. These are just for quasiquote, not macros.
    
    `ToTokens` is no longer implemented for `Arg` (although this could be added again) and `Generics` (which I don't think makes sense).
    
    This breaks any compiler extensions that relied on the ability of `ToTokens` to turn AST fragments back into inspectable token trees. For this reason, this closes #16987.

    std: Remove deprecated/unstable num functionality
    
    This commit removes all the old casting/generic traits from `std::num` that are
    no longer in use by the standard library. This additionally removes the old
    `strconv` module which has not seen much use in quite a long time. All generic
    functionality has been supplanted with traits in the `num` crate and the
    `strconv` module is supplanted with the [rust-strconv crate][rust-strconv].

    Generalize `spawn` beyond unit closures
    
    `thread::spawn` was previously restricted to closures that return `()`,
    which limited the utility of joining on a spawned thread. However, there
    is no reason for this restriction, and this commit allows arbitrary

    De-stabilize `thread::scoped` and friends
    
    Issue #24292 demonstrates that the `scoped` API as currently offered can
    be memory-unsafe: the `JoinGuard` can be moved into a context that will
    fail to execute destructors prior to the stack frame being popped (for
    example, by creating an `Rc` cycle).
    
    This commit reverts the APIs to `unstable` status while a long-term
    solution is worked out.
    
    (There are several possible ways to address this issue; it's not a
    fundamental problem with the `scoped` idea, but rather an indication
    that Rust doesn't currently provide a good way to ensure that
    destructors are run within a particular stack frame.)

    We provide tools to tell what exact symbols to emit for any fn or static, but
    don’t quite check if that won’t cause any issues later on. Some of the issues
    include LLVM mangling our names again and our names pointing to wrong locations,
    us generating dumb foreign call wrappers, linker errors, extern functions
    resolving to different symbols altogether (`extern {fn fail();} fail();` in some
    cases calling `fail1()`), etc.
    
    Before the commit we had a function called `note_unique_llvm_symbol`, so it is
    clear somebody was aware of the issue at some point, but the function was barely
    used, mostly in irrelevant locations.
    
    Along with working on it I took liberty to start refactoring trans/base into
    a few smaller modules. The refactoring is incomplete and I hope I will find some
    motivation to carry on with it.
    
    This is possibly a [breaking-change] because it makes dumbly written code
    properly invalid.
    
    This fixes all those issues about incorrect use of #[no_mangle] being not reported/misreported/ICEd by the compiler.
    
    NB. This PR does not attempt to tackle the parallel codegen issue that was mentioned in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22811, but I believe it should be very straightforward in a follow up PR by modifying `trans::declare::get_defined_value` to look at all the contexts.

    This is a [breaking-change] because it can change the result of comparison operators when enum discriminants have been explicitly assigned.  Notably in a case like:
    ```rust
    #[derive(PartialOrd)]
    enum E { A = 2, B = 1}
    ```
    
    Under the old deriving, `A &lt; B` held, because `A` came before `B` in the order of declaration.  But now we use the ordering according to the provided values, and thus `A &gt; B`.  (However, this change is very unlikely to break much, if any, code, since the orderings themselves should all remain well-defined, total, etc.)

    std: Set CLOEXEC for all fds opened on unix
    
    This commit starts to set the CLOEXEC flag for all files and sockets opened by
    the standard library by default on all unix platforms. There are a few points of
    note in this commit:
    
    * The implementation is not 100% satisfactory in the face of threads. File
      descriptors only have the `F_CLOEXEC` flag set *after* they are opened,
      allowing for a fork/exec to happen in the middle and leak the descriptor.
      Some platforms do support atomically opening a descriptor while setting the
      `CLOEXEC` flag, and it is left as a future extension to bind these apis as it
      is unclear how to do so nicely at this time.
    
    * The implementation does not offer a method of opting into the old behavior of
      not setting `CLOEXEC`. This will possibly be added in the future through
      extensions on `OpenOptions`, for example.
    
    * This change does not yet audit any Windows APIs to see if the handles are
      inherited by default by accident.
    
    This is a breaking change for users who call `fork` or `exec` outside of the
    standard library itself and expect file descriptors to be inherted. All file
    descriptors created by the standard library will no longer be inherited.

     Now that we have a `#[allow_internal_unstable]` attribute for macros there's no
    need for these two `begin_unwind` functions to be stable. Right now the `panic!`
    interface is the only one we wish to stabilize, so remove the stability markers
    from these functions.
    
    While this is a breaking change, it is highly unlikely to break any actual code.
    It is recommended to use the `panic!` macro instead if it breaks explicit calls
    into `std::rt`.

    Improve bounds in Iterator API
    
    This commit changes `Iterator`'s API by:
    
    * Generalizing bounds from `Iterator` to `IntoIterator` whenever
      possible, matching the semantics and ergonomics of `for` loops.
    
    * Tightens up a few method-level bounds so that you get an error
      earlier. For example, `rev` did not require `DoubleEndedIterator` even
      though the result is only an `Iterator` when the original iterator was
      double-ended.
    
    Closes #23587
    
    The bound-tightening is technically a:
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    but no code should break in practice.

    std: Destabilize the internals of panic!
    
    Now that we have a `#[allow_internal_unstable]` attribute for macros there's no
    need for these two `begin_unwind` functions to be stable. Right now the `panic!`
    interface is the only one we wish to stabilize, so remove the stability markers
    from these functions.
    
    While this is a breaking change, it is highly unlikely to break any actual code.
    It is recommended to use the `panic!` macro instead if it breaks explicit calls
    into `std::rt`.

    std: Fix fs::read_link behavior on Windows
    
    The current implementation of using GetFinalPathNameByHandle actually reads all
    intermediate links instead of just looking at the current link. This commit
    alters the behavior of the function to use a different API which correctly reads
    only one level of the soft link.

    Make `sum` and `product` inherent methods on `Iterator`
    
    In addition to being nicer, this also allows you to use `sum` and `product` for
    iterators yielding custom types aside from the standard integers.
    
    Due to removing the `AdditiveIterator` and `MultiplicativeIterator` trait, this
    is a breaking change.

    Add `Sync` to the bounds in `io::Error`
    
    This allows `io::Error` values to be stored in `Arc` properly.

    Introduce trans::declare
    
    We provide tools to tell what exact symbols to emit for any fn or static, but
    don’t quite check if that won’t cause any issues later on. Some of the issues
    include LLVM mangling our names again and our names pointing to wrong locations,
    us generating dumb foreign call wrappers, linker errors, extern functions
    resolving to different symbols altogether (extern {fn fail();} fail(); in some
    cases calling fail1()), etc.
    
    Before the commit we had a function called note_unique_llvm_symbol, so it is
    clear somebody was aware of the issue at some point, but the function was barely
    used, mostly in irrelevant locations.
    
    Along with working on it I took liberty to start refactoring trans/base into
    a few smaller modules. The refactoring is incomplete and I hope I will find some
    motivation to carry on with it.
    
    This is possibly a [breaking-change] because it makes dumbly written code
    properly invalid.

    Auto merge of #23832 - petrochenkov:usize, r=aturon
    
    These constants are small and can fit even in `u8`, but semantically they have type `usize` because they denote sizes and are almost always used in `usize` context. The change of their type to `u32` during the integer audit led only to the large amount of `as usize` noise (see the second commit, which removes this noise).
    
    This is a minor [breaking-change] to an unstable interface.

    Remove `Thunk` struct and `Invoke` trait; change `Thunk` to be an alias
    for `Box&lt;FnBox()&gt;`. I found the alias was still handy because it is
    shorter than the fully written type.
    
    This is a [breaking-change]: convert code using `Invoke` to use `FnBox`,
    which is usually pretty straight-forward. Code using thunk mostly works
    if you change `Thunk::new =&gt; Box::new` and `foo.invoke(arg)` to
    `foo(arg)`.

    std: Stabilize last bits of io::Error
    
    This commit stabilizes a few remaining bits of the `io::Error` type:
    
    * The `Error::new` method is now stable. The last `detail` parameter was removed
      and the second `desc` parameter was generalized to `E: Into&lt;Box&lt;Error&gt;&gt;` to
      allow creating an I/O error from any form of error. Currently there is no form
      of downcasting, but this will be added in time.
    
    * An implementation of `From&lt;&amp;str&gt; for Box&lt;Error&gt;` was added to liballoc to
      allow construction of errors from raw strings.
    
    * The `Error::raw_os_error` method was stabilized as-is.
    
    * Trait impls for `Clone`, `Eq`, and `PartialEq` were removed from `Error` as it
      is not possible to use them with trait objects.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the modification of the `new` method as well as
    the removal of the trait implementations for the `Error` type.

    This change also modifies the `assert_eq!` macro to not consider both directions

    modification is motivated due to the fact that `&amp;[T] == Vec&lt;T&gt;` no longer

    rollup merge of #23766: alexcrichton/stabilize-raw-fd
    
    This commit stabilizes the platform-specific `io` modules, specifically around
    the traits having to do with the raw representation of each object on each
    platform.
    
    Specifically, the following material was stabilized:
    
    * `AsRaw{Fd,Socket,Handle}`
    * `RawFd` (renamed from `Fd`)
    * `RawHandle` (renamed from `Handle`)
    * `RawSocket` (renamed from `Socket`)
    * `AsRaw{Fd,Socket,Handle}` implementations
    * `std::os::{unix, windows}::io`
    
    The following material was added as `#[unstable]`:
    
    * `FromRaw{Fd,Socket,Handle}`
    * Implementations for various primitives
    
    There are a number of future improvements that are possible to make to this
    module, but this should cover a good bit of functionality desired from these
    modules for now. Some specific future additions may include:
    
    * `IntoRawXXX` traits to consume the raw representation and cancel the
      auto-destructor.
    * `Fd`, `Socket`, and `Handle` abstractions that behave like Rust objects and
      have nice methods for various syscalls.
    
    At this time though, these are considered backwards-compatible extensions and
    will not be stabilized at this time.
    
    This commit is a breaking change due to the addition of `Raw` in from of the
    type aliases in each of the platform-specific modules.

    This commit stabilizes the `std::num` module:
    
    * The `Int` and `Float` traits are deprecated in favor of (1) the

      rust-lang/num.
    
    * The `Zero` and `One` traits are reintroduced in `std::num`, which
      together with various other traits allow you to recover the most
      common forms of generic programming.
    
    * The `FromStrRadix` trait, and associated free function, is deprecated
      in favor of inherent implementations.
    
    * A wide range of methods and constants for both integers and floating
      point numbers are now `#[stable]`, having been adjusted for integer
      guidelines.
    
    * `is_positive` and `is_negative` are renamed to `is_sign_positive` and
      `is_sign_negative`, in order to address #22985
    
    * The `Wrapping` type is moved to `std::num` and stabilized;
      `WrappingOps` is deprecated in favor of inherent methods on the
      integer types, and direct implementation of operations on
      `Wrapping&lt;X&gt;` for each concrete integer type `X`.

    Auto merge of #23549 - aturon:stab-num, r=alexcrichton
    
    This commit stabilizes the `std::num` module:
    
    * The `Int` and `Float` traits are deprecated in favor of (1) the
      newly-added inherent methods and (2) the generic traits available in
      rust-lang/num.
    
    * The `Zero` and `One` traits are reintroduced in `std::num`, which
      together with various other traits allow you to recover the most
      common forms of generic programming.
    
    * The `FromStrRadix` trait, and associated free function, is deprecated
      in favor of inherent implementations.
    
    * A wide range of methods and constants for both integers and floating
      point numbers are now `#[stable]`, having been adjusted for integer
      guidelines.
    
    * `is_positive` and `is_negative` are renamed to `is_sign_positive` and
      `is_sign_negative`, in order to address #22985
    
    * The `Wrapping` type is moved to `std::num` and stabilized;
      `WrappingOps` is deprecated in favor of inherent methods on the
      integer types, and direct implementation of operations on
      `Wrapping&lt;X&gt;` for each concrete integer type `X`.

    convert: remove FromError, use From&lt;E&gt; instead
    
    This removes the FromError trait, since it can now be expressed using
    the new convert::Into trait. All implementations of FromError&lt;E&gt; where
    changed to From&lt;E&gt;, and `try!` was changed to use From::from instead.
    
    Because this removes FromError, it is a breaking change, but fixing it
    simply requires changing the words `FromError` to `From`, and
    `from_error` to `from`.

    std: Stabilize the rest of Any/BoxAny
    
    This commit stabilizes the following APIs:
    
    * `TypeId::of` - now that it has an `Any` bound it's ready to be stable.
    * `Box&lt;Any&gt;::downcast` - now that an inherent impl on `Box&lt;Any&gt;` as well as
      `Box&lt;Any+Send&gt;` is allowed the `BoxAny` trait is removed in favor of these
      inherent methods.
    
    This is a breaking change due to the removal of the `BoxAny` trait, but
    consumers can simply remove imports to fix crates.

    Fallout where types must be specified.
    
    This is due to a [breaking-change] to operators. The primary affected
    code is uses of the `Rng` trait where we used to (incorrectly) infer the
    right-hand-side type from the left-hand-side, in the case that the LHS
    type was a scalar like `i32`. The fix is to add a type annotation like
    `x + rng.gen::&lt;i32&gt;()`.

    rustc: Remove support for hyphens in crate names
    
    This commit removes parser support for `extern crate "foo" as bar` as the
    renamed crate is now required to be an identifier. Additionally this commit
    enables hard errors on crate names that contain hyphens in them, they must now
    solely contain alphanumeric characters or underscores.
    
    If the crate name is inferred from the file name, however, the file name
    `foo-bar.rs` will have the crate name inferred as `foo_bar`. If a binary is
    being emitted it will have the name `foo-bar` and a library will have the name
    `libfoo_bar.rlib`.
    
    This commit is a breaking change for a number of reasons:
    
    * Old syntax is being removed. This was previously only issuing warnings.
    * The output for the compiler when input is received on stdin is now `rust_out`
      instead of `rust-out`.
    * The crate name for a crate in the file `foo-bar.rs` is now `foo_bar` which can
      affect infrastructure such as logging.

    std: Stabilize parts of std::os::platform::io
    
    This commit stabilizes the platform-specific `io` modules, specifically around
    the traits having to do with the raw representation of each object on each
    platform.
    
    Specifically, the following material was stabilized:
    
    * `AsRaw{Fd,Socket,Handle}`
    * `RawFd` (renamed from `Fd`)
    * `RawHandle` (renamed from `Handle`)
    * `RawSocket` (renamed from `Socket`)
    * `AsRaw{Fd,Socket,Handle}` implementations
    * `std::os::{unix, windows}::io`
    
    The following material was added as `#[unstable]`:
    
    * `FromRaw{Fd,Socket,Handle}`
    * Implementations for various primitives
    
    There are a number of future improvements that are possible to make to this
    module, but this should cover a good bit of functionality desired from these
    modules for now. Some specific future additions may include:
    
    * `IntoRawXXX` traits to consume the raw representation and cancel the
      auto-destructor.
    * `Fd`, `Socket`, and `Handle` abstractions that behave like Rust objects and
      have nice methods for various syscalls.
    
    At this time though, these are considered backwards-compatible extensions and
    will not be stabilized at this time.
    
    This commit is a breaking change due to the addition of `Raw` in from of the
    type aliases in each of the platform-specific modules.

    rustc: Remove support for old_impl_check
    
    This commit removes compiler support for the `old_impl_check` attribute which
    should in theory be entirely removed now. The last remaining use of it in the
    standard library has been updated by moving the type parameter on the
    `old_io::Acceptor` trait into an associated type. As a result, this is a
    breaking change for all current users of the deprecated `old_io::Acceptor`
    trait. Code can be migrated by using the `Connection` associated type instead.

    Reject specialized Drop impls.
    
    See Issue #8142 for discussion.
    
    This makes it illegal for a Drop impl to be more specialized than the original item.
    
    So for example, all of the following are now rejected (when they would have been blindly accepted before):
    
    ```rust
    struct S&lt;A&gt; { ... };
    impl Drop for S&lt;i8&gt; { ... } // error: specialized to concrete type
    
    struct T&lt;'a&gt; { ... };
    impl Drop for T&lt;'static&gt; { ... } // error: specialized to concrete region
    
    struct U&lt;A&gt; { ... };
    impl&lt;A:Clone&gt; Drop for U&lt;A&gt; { ... } // error: added extra type requirement
    
    struct V&lt;'a,'b&gt;;
    impl&lt;'a,'b:a&gt; Drop for V&lt;'a,'b&gt; { ... } // error: added extra region requirement
    ```
    
    Due to examples like the above, this is a [breaking-change].
    
    (The fix is to either remove the specialization from the `Drop` impl, or to transcribe the requirements into the struct/enum definition; examples of both are shown in the PR's fixed to `libstd`.)

    Implementation notes:
    
    We identify Drop impl specialization by not being as parametric as the
    struct/enum definition via unification.
    
    More specifically:
    
     1. Attempt unification of a skolemized instance of the struct/enum
        with an instance of the Drop impl's type expression where all of
        the impl's generics (i.e. the free variables of the type
        expression) have been replaced with unification variables.
    
     2. If unification fails, then reject Drop impl as specialized.
    
     3. If unification succeeds, check if any of the skolemized
        variables "leaked" into the constraint set for the inference
        context; if so, then reject Drop impl as specialized.
    
     4. Otherwise, unification succeeded without leaking skolemized
        variables: accept the Drop impl.
    
    We identify whether a Drop impl is injecting new predicates by simply
    looking whether the predicate, after an appropriate substitution,
    appears on the struct/enum definition.

    Fallout from changing fn traits to use inheritance rather than bridge
    impls. This is a [breaking-change] (for gated code) in that when you
    implement `Fn` (`FnMut`) you must also implement `FnOnce`. This commit
    demonstrates how to fix it.

    rollup merge of #23601: nikomatsakis/by-value-index
    
    This is a [breaking-change]. When indexing a generic map (hashmap, etc) using the `[]` operator, it is now necessary to borrow explicitly, so change `map[key]` to `map[&amp;key]` (consistent with the `get` routine). However, indexing of string-valued maps with constant strings can now be written `map["abc"]`.

    rollup merge of #23541: aturon/stab-error
    
    This small commit stabilizes the `Error` trait as-is, except that `Send`
    and `Debug` are added as constraints. The `Send` constraint is because
    most uses of `Error` will be for trait objects, and by default we would
    like these objects to be transferrable between threads. The `Debug`
    constraint is to ensure that e.g. `Box&lt;Error&gt;` is `Debug`, and because
    types that implement `Display` should certainly implement `Debug` in any case.
    
    In the near future we expect to add `Any`-like downcasting features to
    `Error`, but this is waiting on some additional
    mechanisms (`Reflect`). It will be added before 1.0 via default methods.

    Add generic conversion traits
    
    This commit:
    
    * Introduces `std::convert`, providing an implementation of
    RFC 529.
    
    * Deprecates the `AsPath`, `AsOsStr`, and `IntoBytes` traits, all
    in favor of the corresponding generic conversion traits.
    
      Consequently, various IO APIs now take `AsRef&lt;Path&gt;` rather than
    `AsPath`, and so on. Since the types provided by `std` implement both
    traits, this should cause relatively little breakage.
    
    * Deprecates many `from_foo` constructors in favor of `from`.
    
    * Changes `PathBuf::new` to take no argument (creating an empty buffer,
      as per convention). The previous behavior is now available as
      `PathBuf::from`.
    
    * De-stabilizes `IntoCow`. It's not clear whether we need this separate trait.

    When matching against a pattern (either via `match` or `let`) that
    contains ref-bindings, do not permit any upcasting from the type of
    the value being matched. Similarly, do not permit coercion in a `let`.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] in that it closes a type hole that
    previously existed, and in that coercion is not performed. You should
    be able to work around the latter by converting:
    
    ```rust
    let ref mut x: T = expr;
    ```
    
    into
    
    ```rust
    let x: T = expr;
    let ref mut x = x;
    ```
    
    Restricting coercion not to apply in the case of `let ref` or `let ref mut` is sort
    of unexciting to me, but seems the best solution:
    
    1. Mixing coercion and `let ref` or `let ref mut` is a bit odd, because you are taking
       the address of a (coerced) temporary, but only sometimes. It's not syntactically evident,
       in other words, what's going on. When you're doing a coercion, you're kind of
    
    2. Put another way, I would like to preserve the relationship that
       `equality &lt;= subtyping &lt;= coercion &lt;= as-coercion`, where this is
       an indication of the number of `(T1,T2)` pairs that are accepted by
       the various relations. Trying to mix `let ref mut` and coercion
       would create another kind of relation that is like coercion, but
       acts differently in the case where a precise match is needed.
    
    3. In any case, this is strictly more conservative than what we had
       before and we can undo it in the future if we find a way to make
       coercion mix with type equality.
    
    The change to match I feel ok about but similarly unthrilled. There is
    some subtle text already concerning whether to use eqtype or subtype
    for identifier bindings. The best fix I think would be to always have
    match use strict equality but use subtyping on identifier bindings,
    but the comment `(*)` explains why that's not working at the moment.
    As above, I think we can change this as we clean up the code there.

    Added panic-on-overflow for rhs of left and right shift expressions.
    
    This includes a slight refactoring of the `cast_shift_rhs` and related
    functions in `trans::base`, so that I can call them from much later in
    the compiler's control flow (so that we can clearly dilineate where
    automatic conversions of the RHS occur, versus where we check it).
    
    The rhs-checking and fallback-masking is generalized to 8- and 16-bit
    values, and the fallback-masking is turned on unconditionally.
    
    Fix #10183.
    
    Is this a [breaking-change]?  I would argue it is not; it only adds a
    strict definition to what was previously undefined behavior; however,
    there might be code that was e.g. assuming that `1_i8 &lt;&lt; 17` yields 0.
    (This happens in certain contexts and at certain optimization levels.)
